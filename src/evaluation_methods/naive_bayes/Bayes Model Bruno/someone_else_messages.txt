It has been going well. My family and I are celebrating Christmas tonight at my house, which should be nice. How are you? I hope you are feeling better!

Merry Christmas!

We should definitely go back to the shopping center again. I felt so bad about leaving you dying, but I'm glad you're okay.

Are you doing anything for the holidays?

Nice! Me too. It has been relaxing to be free from schoolwork, but I look forward to heading back and seeing friends again!
Feliz Ano Novo!!

Oi Bruno! Como é você? Já encontrou um projeito ou um trabalho?

Not bad. I'm learning a ton about the Mexican Revolution, and my job has been extremely chill (they've been paying me to sit around and read a book).
Ah... as you can see, my Portuguese is a little rough. Will have to work on that before you return.

Muito bom! I've been going to Berkeley almost every day this week to view some of their archives and am having fun with that! I've also been doing a lot of biking and trying to learn French.
How about you?

Hey Bruno! Are y’all at the main quad?

Kinda lost

I’m in the square

I front the church

Where’s the oval?

Alright
I’m at the grass thing

I see it!
Thanks bro

I’m heading over for lunch now!

🐦
Give my playlist a listen: альт-рок и эмо https://spotify.link/qaobFgbveDb

Thanks bro, you have great music taste

I gotta show you some more songs I like, we’ll find one you like

Hahaha

Here
We are done, text me when you are

I’m ready

I’m heading out rn
I’ll meet you at the cross road
Actually meet me at the stern cuz it’s in the same direction

The donner entrance is like 5 steps from the fair

Hey, yeah I agree

To your second text
sorry I keep comparing you to my ex, I use it as a defense mechanism when I’m scared. But it’s very unfair to do that to you

I’ll think about this when I’m more rational haha

I’m feel bad for implying it was too soon, because that should be your opinion, not mine to make
Anyways
Time is the universal solvent
So we should talk bout this later

Haha, I thought you didn’t know shit bout chem🤔

Yeah maybe it was. But no matter what happens, we should try to stay friends cuz you are cool af

Yes I will. Thanks for giving me time

Aight🐤
Did you know people are fountain hopping at 11?
My roommate wants do it and refuses to bring a towel
Louca

I just woke up as well lol
Do you prefer to talk over text or in person?

Haha yeah I am very coordinated as you can tell
It’ll be fun
We should still find a time to talk about yesterday though 👀

Oof im at the we are stem panel
But it’s not very helpful. Do you wanna meet up?

No, not really

I’m at tressider memorial union

Do you prefer being inside or outside

I’ll see you at Branner then

I’m here
🦑
Hey I’m gonna look around here with Kaylee!
We are gonna go to dinner. I’m a bit (very) hungry
She wants to go to the s’mores event, I might go with her….🥺👉👈

Hey!

Not sure
I’m not sure I enjoy dancing

Aww thank you

You aren’t hungry?

I appreciate that Bruno

I can go with you to look around, but I won’t be dancing lol

No bro, not this time ;(

Ok, we can go check that out!

Aww I’m touched you think I’m pretty
I’m also very lucky to hangout with you

Ok, lemme finish dinner
I’ll get going in 5
Bruno,
Someone just pointed out to me

That the disco event is for the DisCo community, the disabled community

It’s like going to the Asian American party but not being Asian American

Well shit
You wanna go to the theatre showcase?

‎image omitted

Alright

I was gonna go to donner to grab a jacket for you too lol
Yeah Branner

I just got to my floor

I’m coming down

What is that entrance

I’m heading towards the red statue

Hahaha just head towards Branner then I

There is only brunch tmr, so no breakfast

So remember how I told you how slow people in China take physical touch?
For me, physical touch = emotional closeness
But that’s not what it means for you
So it’s confusing for me

I know. But hear my logic
I see physical touch as something people do when they are really into each other, usually in a relationship
But we have different concepts

Idk, I just want to tell you how I feel

🦑
I’m going to bag check
It’s far

I won’t be able to find you again lol

Nah

I haven’t event gotten to the place yet

Beo
Bro…

Ya should’ve followed me

Not in the seat area
The highest place possible
‎image omitted

Fuck, I was just about to text you something

That might disturb your sleep

Ok you ready, it’s a bit long

I think we should stay friends. You are a pretty great human being and anyone would be lucky to have you; we just don’t fit other very well romantically.
For one, I’m still learning to communicate and identify my feelings, and my improvements are too slow for what you and me need.
I also feel like most times we focus on your enjoyment but not my enjoyment. I pushed myself to go check out parties and sports games cuz I wanted to hang out with you and I thought it would make you happy, even though I don’t enjoy these things. I’m giving up too much in exchange to hang out with you. I also want to prioritize my own happiness now.
So yeah, if we keep the option of dating open, I would feel pressure to do thing I don’t enjoy to hang out with you. It is not your fault, since ultimately it is my choice. But I honestly think it would benefit both of us to just be friends. You would feel less pressure as well I think.

Thanks for being understanding Bruno 🥺
I’m glad you are my friend. I really do like you as a human being

Hahahah, you are still a cute puppy 🫳🐶

Yeah that was my fear as well. I’m glad I man-ed up for once
To say what I’m feeling

Oh read my last two messages as one sentence. I accidentally sent it on two parts

Thank you for the advice. I hope I can be more self assured as well.
If they ask, I don’t mind you telling.

Haha, I’m glad you won’t

thats very kind of you

‎image omitted
Left in a hurry huh 😂
You’ll lose your visa because of this serious criminal offense

Hmmm I’ll send in a good word to the judge if you give me $20

Fuck you got me
But I don’t have that kind of money

I can give you 500 sparkling water

‎image omitted

Give me 500 and I won’t send this dog to your room

On a serious note, do you have a sore throat?

My roommate is sick, I might also be sick

Haha I was just worried cuz you kept saying you’re tired

Explain more about how you feel

Nah, I got time

Kinda

You teacher will prob email you or post about it on canvas

Lucky

Unlikely but It’s also ok if you do. Your teachers will understand

And who does

So? You learn how to, that’s the most important part.
If you already knew everything, why come to college

It’s ok to feel unprepared. I feel the same. But im also confident I can handle what ever comes
Because I’ve been doing that all my life, handling and learning things
You too

What is that

Hmm I really do understand how you feel.
But idk how to make you feel better :(

Trust me, I’m still experiencing it

hug hug

So what are you so busy with that you can’t go to dinner
You’ll meet more of them. Just takes time.

If strategy board games taught me one thing, it’s patience and steadiness
Relatable
I don’t wanna talk with my mom cuz I feel like imma cry

I missed home a ton during my first week in the US
I would cry when my roommate fell asleep
But everything gets better so

Yeah, I’m overwhelmed too
But I just do one thing at a time…and I’ll come out the other end

Then rest for now, you can do them later. Or delegate to someone else

Depends on the situation. Like I don’t have time to look for cheap tickets
So my mom is helping me
Otherwise, imma be driven insane

Yeah…I wish I could help you more

well I’m an…engineer, I wanna solve problems

Data science 💪

But I’m trying to let it out more

There’s no music? Or am I deaf

I’ll listen to it in a quieter place

Hahaha

You gaslighter

I just got back
Ahhh yeah I can relate. I’m also not great at bowling
So I went to play the arcade game at the bowling place instea
You are just too hard on yourself. You are great at bowling
The people in donner are pregaming. I can smell the booze just walking by the room
When you coming back?

Yeah

Woah looks good!

Is it bed time?

No

Loll, I’m in pjs already

No 🤮
Lol you wanna go?
I’m just very offput by drunk people

Yeahhhh

Yeah I loved those nights in highschool where we played hidden identity games while gossiping and complaining bout life haha

the ancient Romans liked to recline on a couches, drink wine, eat good food, and talk with friends
That’s their idea of a dinner party (men only of course)

‎image omitted

Cool people

Hahaha…me too though…jus the opposite problem

Lmaoo, that is not how I would describe my friendships

Yeah ok
My friends were crazy (in a good way) and they accepted my weirdness as well. So no worries about reputation. We knew enough blackmail information about each other that we could end each others careers lol
Crazy as in crazy nerdy about something

Bruh that ending
😂 must have been smoking something

Yeah he looks familiar

My humor is strange tho👀
You ain’t getting me with the conventional stuff

😂

Yep, she told me quote if I’m stressed, just go watch porn
Doesn’t work though

Hmmm yeah
I used to read manga and fan fiction to relieve stress

Ahhh yeah me too
Man I haven’t checked the updates in forever
Is your roommate at the party?

My roommate is idk where
I hope I don’t have to smell booze tonight

What kind do you read?

Yeah let’s see
I was reading this one recently. very funny
‎image omitted

What’s the assignment

Well what’s in the directions?

What’s in “click here”

Yeah you could always email if confused
man I don’t wanna get out of bed

A quiz in the first week?

Nice

Like a syllabus quiz?
I have to do that as well lol

Hmm I see

Lol
Yesterday…I got woken up by noise at 2am. But I thought it was my alarm and that it was morning.
And I layed in bed listening to the voices outside my door
And my confused brain thought I heard your voice

So I got out of bed, and was about to open the door
When I heard my roommate wake up. And that made me wake up more
And I was like why would you be here
Lmaoo and then I realize it was 2am not morning yet

Hahahaha

Great first impression

What happened?

Huh a stress dream
I hate those

Do you like to analyze dreams or do you think dreams are just weird brain activity

Hmmm, I wonder why you dreamt of another human trying to hurt you then

It’s a common dream?
That’s interesting

Interesting
I never dream of people I know

Yes. I would know the people in my dream, but they don’t exist in reality
Just random ass people my brain crates

Hahaha
In reality no
But when I wake up, you are in my thoughts almost every second
(,,>﹏<,,)
It’s because I talk so much shit about you to everyone
/j

You have to respect my beliefs. You are in America

There is no truth, only speculation

😂 you only read what I want you to read
Have you thought about that

Uh oh

good luck on your actual reading though, let me know if you wanna discuss
Not sure if you got my point so I’ll reiterate. I am the author of myself. You might think you can read me, but in reality, you are only reading what I have written for you to see
Ooo metaphors
I love metaphors. Beautiful like a puppy

Yeah? ૮ ･ ﻌ･ა

Well said
It’s a shame you don’t like the humanities more

I think you two would find value in each other

Ahh

Yeah that doesn’t capture the essence and goal of the humanities

Yep

That’s why I’m so interested in education

It’s so important, yet no one in power cares
Because they use it as a tool to do crowd control

That’s a very hard questions. (how would you introduce me to the real point of math?) and I’m not a great teacher. However, I would prob start with this book
‎image omitted

And have you discuss the short excerpts with a good group of studnegsv
It’s not a full on book. It’s short excerpts from Greek philosopher

Very short paragraphs, easy to read

Hmmmm just like how history is not about memorizing historical facts
But they are important to know
I can see your point

‎image omitted
I saw these the last time I went to the book store

No idea what game theory is tho

Making the other person take a factor of 20
Oh wait we want the last

Lemme shower first yeah?

I’ve been standing in a towel for like 30 mins hahaha

Let’s do the game
But why are there two piles

Haha

I’ll go first
2 from p1

Wait there’s no limit to how many rocks you can take?

艹
Umm lemme think
Whatever, 1 from p2

Stop copying me
Wtf why are there two pilesb

Why make this question have two piles
It’s so much easier with 1

Does it matter who goes first

Did I fuck up

Hmm give me some time on this
Or a hint

Nah, I’m gonna give it a try.
Ok

And you have to get the last rock form both piles? How is that physically possible

Ohhh I get it more now
So it’s the last last stone

Not the last stone from each pile

Ok

Then my strategy might work
Prepare to lose

Haha I’m just joking, my strategy is only half formed
Is it not always 2 players?

Ohh, I’m not ready yet, I still have to test it
I gotta do my Ling quiz first
Man this game is hurting my brain

Lol
I think I’ll stick to liking math in a humanities way

Brunch soon?

Do you have a bandaid

You can come in right?
Or do I need to open the door

Which door you at?

Bruh

Yess I’m done

Imma go to donner to grab my stuff

Haha I’m just exaggerating

Yeah?
But I prefer you having hair
So I can floof it
🫳🐶

Why not

But if you keep the dick hairstyle
That’s a nao

As long as you are genuinely reflecting, it doesn matter how “grand” or philosophical your writing is
If people have good character, they won’t judge you

Welp

Comparisons is the thief of joy
Do your own thing. I trust that it’s good

Hmm wanna come check out terra?

And feeling dumb

Haha thanks for the encouragement. I really need to hear it sometimes

Yeah rationally thinking, there’s some truth in that

Lmaoo I felt that in American high school

I know. Ive been warned about becoming an “average” student
But I’m ok with that. Honestly. As long as I feel like I’m learning and making progress

Yeah, I agree
I do language learning. I know how the little steps add up
but the frustration doesn’t go away. It’s part of the process

Hehe, I’m literally texting during a lectur
You are a bad influence puppy

Good luck on your hw

Fascinating ESF lecture today. It’s by a math professor talking about liberal arts education

He raised a point that the definition of liberal arts education changes as the times changed…and we should now consider how “stem” courses like engineering fits into the liberal arts curriculum
I’ve never thought about this kinda fusion before
He also talked shit about cs majors.
Just kidding haha
And it gives a solution to the death of the “humanities department.” Damn

We had to pick just two. I did love (which is kinda like belonging for me) and meaningful work
What about you

Happiness and
Community?

Yeah

It’s a good one

Yeah, that’s why I picked love
Cuz I think that’s the root of any relationship

A kinda of love for their humanity
And I mean relationship very broadly

‎image omitted
I’m thinking more in this sense of love

Haha I completely understand what you mean
Ooof too relatable
Do I love someone because I have to

Which is understandable
I don’t feel “love” for my sister.
Ok this is a much deeper conversation

Because now I have a ton of questions I need to ask myself
Not a lot

I do want to know bout you and the other parts of Bruno
Last parting thought. I once wondered if I were psychopathic because I didn’t know if I loved my dad

Woah, you gotta tell me bout what changed
Man…I wanna be with you right now
Fuck my life

This is worse than being blue balled

Ok. I can’t stand to say no

Yep

Does this mean done?

Oh, ok I’m coming

I love the number 98
Very pretty

I’ll have to check the ingredients list after my roommate leaves

Was she serious or joking?

Lol ok then

Interesting thing to say

Oh that’s joking

Ok, well she can have her opinion

Even though I disagree

😂

I can understand how you feel

But also not everyone is used to philosophical conversation so
Hahaha that’s most badly defined logic I’ve ever heard

Maybe she would like Kant and the categorical imperative

Yeah it’s a very simplified way of thinking. Not practical
But there is value in it
Your experience reminds me something that happened to me.
Ehh long story short, a friend I’m not close with ‘jokingly’ called me “a terrible person” in front of my highschool advisor ‎<This message was edited>

I ran into charlotte and Michael
And charlotte was like I saw Bruno coming out of your room. What’s going on ‎<This message was edited>

Michael asked if we were dating

I said yeah
Is that an accurate answer

Charlotte said it with a teasing attitude
Michael asked in private
Idk what their reaction was. I was already close to my room when charlotte asked

I was very flustered
‎sticker omitted
Does he talk to you a lot?

Oh well. I guess this is not a bad way for people to know

yeah I was so focused on the ice cream

Oop I misread lol
Yeah you cant imagine how flustered I feel saying that

Just tossed my phone away
‎sticker omitted

Yep, so I have some comments on small things

this is a personal preference but I would shorten the description of the accomplishments section. E.g. the first one you say “gold and bronze medalist….3rd out of 6 mil.” I would leave out the 3rd out of 6 mil part, because the size of the number feels weird and you don’t need to include it if you already said gold medalist

If you really want to include it you could use a percentile? Like top 99.9th percentile

capitalization: “gold medal” no capitalization. “Brazil National Olympiad” should be capitalized like this
Last thing. The grey coloring on the left is a bit hard to read.

Other than that it looks good to me.  If you want actually helpful advice, you should ask the career centre people 😂

Yep. Great start

HA! Solid advice
Damn I need to listen to that advice
But my brain would rather me suffer alone than show weakness
Tsk tsk tsk

I suffer and succeed. But asking for help lessens the suffering

Hahah I see what you mean

I was just bout to ask

Aw Thanks!! I’ll check it out tonight

Ahh I’m sorry that’s happening
The fuck is he doing

Alright, just try to relax

I can understand haha
It has happened to me befor too
My highscool roommate was eating at 1am
And her spoon kept clanking against her glass bowl
And I wanted to kill someone

Yeah unfortunately we just have to become desensitized
And talk to your roommate about it
Hope you get some rest! You can sleep in if you want. we could always go to the gym later in the day

Wherever you want to go
If you don’t care, we can go to stern

I’ll see ya there then!
Do you need me to open the door or no

😂
My brain is barely functioning as well

I was in my ESF class. The classroom is so beautiful. Dark brown wood, golden sunlight, rustling leaves outside, and very very warm.
All I could think was how it’s such a perfect place for a nap ‎<This message was edited>

You calling me a bad student? ><
What’s the place for a nap then?
In your arms? ;)

Why don’t you write what you want to say? Is your response based on your readings?

Interesting approach to the topic
Im sure your prof’s comments will be more helpful than mine

Yeah I can see that

Very understandable

Aww, no pressure though. You could give me a cool leaf and I’ll be happy

Hahahaha

Lmaooo
Lolll I wonder if that’s a reflection of the game creator. Maybe their language of affection is gift giving

Well in Detroit: become human, it was all about what you say and what you do
so it was a deliberate choice

Or maybe just a lazy choice to have gift giving as the way to build relationships

Then why build relationships

When can you eat dinner tonight?

Do you have a late cs discuss?
Oh right
My frosh ends 5:50. So does 6 sound good?
Weirdly miss seeing ya ✨

I think I get what you are trying to say.
But my purpose of comforting you is not to have you agree with me, but trying different ways to make you feel better
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t

So I won’t think you dislike my effort. But I’m glad you clarified
The only negative thing I feel is I wish I could’ve done something more helpful. But that’s just my people-pleaser brain being anxious

It means you won’t feel happy. You’ll feel any emotion but happiness

Haha me too

But this dude was like imma live my whole life cuz living is cool

Yeah makes sense
Haha just because y’all don’t agree doesn’t mean he’s stupid

I’m coming over in 5 mins, that’s ok?

Here
Hey I should’ve asked in person but are you a bit upset?

Ah makes sense

It’s ok. I felt that was what you were feeling

Maybe you felt a bit out of control cuz of finals, and the game was a way to regain that

And maybe it’s not time for my crazy psychoanalysis

Ahh I dislike this feeling as well

Hey, you gave me such a huge head start

You are a great chess player, one game isn’t gonna change that

I understand

😱
Hmmm, how are you feeling? Do you want a quiet evening?

True, my logic was all disrupted by this news
Do you want to eat something tonight?
When do you want me to come over

The “ask dad bout game” is the only one I completed
😢

I haven’t finished my pt lesson yet, didn’t start on my calc, and I have to make a savings account

Gotcha
Ahmm entendi

Fuck I need my WeChat stickers

Of course not

Oh m

Wow it’s so interesting to learn about the past tense of Dizer

Eu fiz

Common, it was impossible to not

Only for you

Haha

You are such a tease
But I’m not complaining
Damn, I love my memory. I have an HD copy of both your pics stored in my mind

I may not remember important things

But I remember your hot ass body

Omg you so freaking cute

Awwww

Awwww, standing ovation 👏

Damn I wish I could remember my sister’s cute phase
But I think I found her annoying all the way through until 2 years ago

Yeah she is
You know what this kid said to me

Haha why is this slightly too true ‎<This message was edited>
The first day I came back, I took a peek at the gym setup in my neighborhood. And then later, I ate lunch and was like “damn I’m still hungry”
And my sister was like “it’s ok, you spent a lot of energy looking at the gym equipment” 😂😂😂

Yeah, she has a good personality

Hahahahah

Haha, I will happily give that title to her in athletics

Yeah, you have an unfair advantage of dark jokes

Hahahaha

The suspense!
Fucking hell that’s so good
Oh my god
It’s artful
And you look so good
and you are holding your dick

What a pleasant surprise. I was wondering why the pic wasn’t loading
Hmmm, I’m gonna revisit that pic on your phone when I see you in person

Fuck
My

você dormiu tarde ontem à noite?

What’s up?

I’m glad you liked it

I really hesitated about sharing it

Cuz I was like oh no what if you think it’s cringe

Ahhh I’m happy you liked it

i was feeling a bit down this evening
But you always manage to make my days better

Lmaoo

You can pic when you want it
*pick

Ok one-marshello-guy
‎image omitted

Lol, I was referencing the Stanford marshmallow experiment

Ooo, you might have heard of it though. It’s about delayed gratification. You give a child one marshmllow and say if you wait x minutes, I’ll give you two marshmallows

Honestly I didn’t either
I just looked it up

Hahahahha
I know you would

It’s so cute how you are like “nuh uh, I’m mature~!”
Ok jokes aside
That’s pretty smart

Omg
Bruno-san >///<

Hmm maybe I should watch some anime

Hahaha

Coolest thing I’ve ever seen, also, the music reminds me of outer wilds

All I heard was tic toc tic toc
I'm gonna buy stardew valley

how did you sleep?
‎This message was deleted.

a little bit

YES

fuck yyou
;-;

this is so sad. You should do something to make up for your teasing

like promise me cuddle time

ok, I want 20 mins of cuddle time, any way I want,

oh I'm not complaining
Yayyyy

oh my is that your brother who's making the pouty face?

omg it reminded me of when you make you sad pouty face, so cute
yummmmm
hot

haha sure
I know you were sweating from looking at you own hot reflection

you do ;
are you busy today with the holidays?

mmm I figured. I want to play stardew valley with you sometime

bought and downloaded

Ok I’ll start my own save then

Can you just join a save? Or do I need to make it a co-op world

Ok
The music is so nice

Well, I was gonna sleep soon, but now I wanna play the game for maybe 10 mins

Haha, Christmas is not a big thing here
It’s more of a shopping event
But if Santa were real, I only have one thing I want right now ‎<This message was edited>

Attached to the rest of you yes
I miss being near you

can’t promise ;)

Ok I promise 🤞

What’s up?

I may have just spent 1.5 hours playing the game

I keep wondering where my heath bar is
I accidentally sold all my wood
I gave the blacksmith a geode and he hated it :(

I’m enjoying the game
Sure

I’m in the dark though
that was so hot, I’m physically horny now ;-;

Hahaha
Maybe I haven’t learned my lesson
You’ll have to do that again

Hmm, tempting

Good night bunbun

Bom dia!

Merry Christmas!

verdade hahah

Ooo pretty useful
Interesting 🤔
Uh oh, inaccuracies. There IS a future tense (marker) in mandarin

Oh nice, any suggestions? ‎<This message was edited>
Oh your vernacular is not the only thing I’m manipulating 😉
But the way you speak also affects me. It took me months to take “yessir” out of my vocabulary, but because you say it, I want to say it as wellll

because it didn’t fit me
It’s like me saying bro
Kinda cringe in my opinion

Ahhhh I see, the words are coming together

thankyouu

Hmm, I’ll see

Cool cool
I’m so hungry eu não consigo me levantar

Cutee
You look so happy

Oh…

Hahaha

Omg

I can imagine your face ‎<This message was edited>

Hahaha oh bunbun

I can understand that
Ahh, that’s a tough mindset

Hahahah

Good luck

But I am also the same way

It’s just that I can continue (for a little bit) even if I’m not having fun

Yeah

Hey at least you know this about yourself
you know what works for you

Nice!

Yum yum
You eat more rice than i do
I haven’t had rice since coming back

Yeah the rice looks great

My..shitty…rice?
You wanna say that again :)

Chinese rice is amazing, I’m just trying to not eat white rice

How did you do that

Ok, I’ll hold you up to that

if it’s not, we are breaking up
Hahaha
Damn that’s a big wager

35! 😂😂
Goddamn

hopefully google sheets can handle such a big number 🙏🙏

🫣 it’s not even flattery

Ahh I see
Wow, I like your logic
And your flattery

😮

Haha what logic

😫😫

You’re not good at lying
You mean

Ok

I must have a big brain then, cuz it’s constantly thinking about your dick
And your hot ass body
😂😂 oh man

And you said you were a boobs man ‎<This message was edited>

Oh, that’s actually very considerate of you
im touched

I feel the same

I wonder how true that is

Who knows, I think I’ll need to see a data set
Hmm maybe there’s a cultural taboo for women to ask for sex
Cuz you know how men who fuck a lot are seen as chads, while women who fuck a lot are called sluts ‎<This message was edited>

Loll I said see, not make

Hahahah catchy
Hahaha why walking though, I’ll have to try if that helps

🤨

Yeah I love biking
Oh is that a new brand of bikes? Haven’t heard

:0
too bad, you promised

hahahah

doesn't matter. I'm getting my cuddling time with you
I'm just upset for no reason

maybe something is wrong but I don't know what yet
but i kinda want to cry haha

i just did my eyeliner

part of it is def body dismorphia
oh well

haha that made me smile

thanks for telling me that

I didn't realize how much I was feeling until talking to you about it

this is so terrible to say, but I feel like I don't like being home right now

ah, we should talk bout this later

I really appreciate that bunbun, but it is freaking christmas for you and your fam

and maybe after a bit i'll be fine again
aww

I'm just being dramatic...it's like a lot of little things

like things have changed so much I'm not prepared

cool painting, very japanese
hehe your bicep
well be prepared (and don't worry if you have to go)

1. I feel so distant from my mom, my dad, and my sister. like i literally barely talk with them, cuz there is just nothing to say....and I feel like I'm wasting my limited time with them.
2. I feel like I look like shit for the past two days. This is completely irrational I believe because I should still look the same as I did
3. I am spending so much money here. Buying shit I need and want. And it makes me feel terrible, it's like the only reason I came back is to use my parents money
4. I told you before that I feel like the living conditions here is a slight downgrade from stanford. I just feel so anxious and guilty about ahhh i don't know
5. related to 4, I feel so useless. I wish I could make money to take some of the burden off
ok rant over

sure
hope it's not too annoying. I don't do this often lol

ah you are making me cry, not in a bad way though

i'm trying to do enough, but I should be trying harder but i don't want

thank you bunbun, you really make me feel better. I think sometimes I just need a rational reminder

I'm so glad I have you, so caring

awww

that's so heartwarming to hear
haha we need to find a better word than selfish

mm I can relate to that

yes, a lot better

‎sticker omitted
by having a good evening and good night of sleep?
maybe one more picture of you

a normal picture ;)

that's soo cute
I think I’m satisfied

‎image omitted
Hahah

But, thank you bunbun. You make me believe in Santa again cuz you are the best gift I have received

I’m glad you feel that way. I doubt that sometimes cuz idk, I’m not great at helping people when they feel down
But I’m sure I can help you feel better in other ways

Haha
That’s a good thing! Balanced

I feel like that’s an understatement

Ahaha
Well at least I take responsibility for it né

Hehe

It makes sense?

According to this website, you can get a round trip for around 1500

$

Yeah..
Wtf that’s atually cheap compared to the other choices 😭

NO WAY

i have a cat now!!
what pet did you pick

of course

hm?

‎sticker omitted

masturbating without you makes me more horny 😫

when I do come, it's nice for a few minutes then I'm horny again

it's a self perpetuating cycle, the orgasms begin to feel less satisfying

and my orgasms are strange when I do it myself...it's like not a full one

yep
it's not a big deal, it's still good, I just have to wait for the horniness to pass

maybe it's you lol, I want you

‎sticker omitted

that sounds good, in theory

but I need more time to get over my discomfort about masturbating with someone knowing I'm masterbating

yeah that's important
I'll start putting thought towards this

Hahah I’m _really_ looking forward to that

fuckkk
i'll text her as soon as I'm in the u.s.

rest assured I will try
I just sent her a text on instagram but I don't think she's active that
yep, it's bed time for me
btw, what pet did you get in sv

. ‎<This message was edited>

:0

i disagree, I was thinking wow I wish i could have a pet, and boom, cat shows up
it's the best part of my 13 day gameplay so far

yep

it just said preference, i didn't know i would get to have it as a pet

don't cringe

Oh i can't take a screen shot
I put you

haha

what

‎sticker omitted

No no, that’s not true

You have a taste as well

It’s good, other wise I wouldn’t like blowing you
It’s very distinctly you
And when ever I see your dick

My mind recreate that taste
^Fun fact hah

Hmm
that’s a good question
I just assumed everyone had a different taste
Like how everyone smells different

‎sticker omitted

Haha, I want to kiss you too

Hmm I agree

I have no idea how though, but I’ll try

Someone just started an audio call to me
Wtf

So creepy

Eu não entendo

*eu não sei

Fuck
Hard decision
You know I won’t be making any sound right
Cuz ain’t no way I’m doing that in my house

I’ll try, I just wish you were here with me
No promises though

‎image omitted

The cat at your doorstep

I do hope you enjoy it
Damn, challenging my mental block is not the most comfortable thing to do
I’m might be requesting some extra cuddling time
Advanced cuddling time

Bom dia

Bem, e vc?

Damn look at the top comment
Aww I’m glad!

I forgot spicy food existed, so I ate a pepper and lost hearing for a few minutes

oh I remember that!
lmao, but I was talking about my bare ass hanging out if i didn't wear pjs

ok
😫

this is closer to my reaction😙

ok, I'm annoyed because you are not wrong
actually, you are the most correct

i will conceed this time
wait not the right word

o que e sua reação?
ahh

ohh interesting
i haven't learnt bout this yet

haha ok, your request is acknowledged.
and I will try to deliver
<3
you know what i'm craving

the warms of your back to my chest as I hug you on the bed
and holding your waist and feeling your stomach

where are you right now?

don't need to do it now, but I want to see you (in a pic or smt)

something

Hey
Proof of shower

‎image omitted
Sorry I didn’t see your WeChat text
When I have vpn on, notifications go wacky

covered lmaoo
i have one titty covered
me fucking too

maybe, might just be the lighting
I'm glad you think so. I needed to hear that

hahaha

hmm, I think i'll need to consult my legal team

hahahha omg

i remember this scene
very badass

do you actually want another view?

now that's just excessive haha

🫣
‎image omitted

yes, I think it made me more grateful of having you be a part of my life

because, idk, more time to refect on how you have helped me, made me happier, made me laugh

I knew I would miss you. But i didn't know it would feel like this...because it's not a empty feeling, it's more of a overflowing feeling of "I want to shower you with care but I'm limited by physical space"
good thing we feel the same ;)
I like you so damn much
I've literally turned into a cringe poet
i thought the sunset looked beautiful and thought of you
I thought the moon veiled by the clouds looked so lovely and thought of you

what happens if i like you too much?

everything in excess is bad
that's why you only get 2 copies

ahh that's what I strive for too. Don't worry. I'm a rational person

‎This message was deleted.

Boa noite
I’m gonna tell you something because it’s weighing on my mind. My mom just asked me to flex my bicep (lol ok), said looks good (thanks), then told me “ok you can start losing weight now.”
So I was like, don’t say it like that cuz that hurts my feelings. She mocked what I said and started laughing. I left her room and she was still laughing omg.
I found this interaction so absurd and upsetting that I started laughing

time flies when you talk with a *hot* guy

haha
I'm glad that's the case

Fascinating

hahhaha doesn’t everyone. But you know what I realized
In situations like this, most people are too anxious on how they themselves look than to focus on how I look
But she looks great in the video
Idk what she is talking about

awww
That made me happy

When was your worst Lmaoo
I legit think you always look great

(Except when you have your annoyed face)
O my

Alright

Sure!
Man it’s still a bit hard to see myself in photos
This is pro Brazil propaganda…because you made fun of my pt accent once 🫣
Haha I saw this one a lot of ago and it still made me chuckle

I was researching bilingual parenting technique when I was 10 cuz i wanted to try on my sister

well I do hope that comes true

Oh man haha

Well if I ever have a kid, my goal would be to train them with the skills to self-regulate themselves into an intelligent and empathetic person

Both to themselves and other people

yeah

Hahha

Won’t be easy though, have you ever tried convincing your parents to pick up a habit? I imagine that’s how working with a kid would be, if not worse ‎<This message was edited>
Lol anyways, parenting is hardddd. That’s why so many fuck it up so bad ‎<This message was edited>

Yeah but it’s the translation process that’s the challenge

thats a good mindset

Hehe I believe in you

i went to the gym with my dad, very interesting experience ‎<This message was edited>
it was chest day so I asked him to try my workout instead of just doing cardio
this man, omg

I forget that not everyone is observant
I showed him how i do inclined bench, and he kept holding the weights vertically
I showed him 20lb first, and then he did 25lb
I also do 25lb. but he was like no it's too heavy for you
and I was like no, it's not (like a boss)

haha omg i almost forgot
the first one he did

of course, you think your girlfriend is all talk no game?
instead of going elbows down, he freaking opened his chest, and I thought he was gonna rip his freaking sholders

uhh i didnt notice cuz i was doing my reps
and then he asked, is it popular for women to work out in the u.s.

intersting line of questioning don't you think

oh
my
god😫

hehe, I did mention that to him because he wanted to lose weight
but idk, cardio is more familiar to him, and it's hard to get him to try new things

yeah

hahah i am very flattered ‎<This message was edited>

why did you think I was so motivated huh

why?

well, lets just say I was muito impressed by your strength, physique, and discipline
i had to google how to spell physique

bitch you know that aint true
if i say you do, then you do
you don't want to be wrong right?

lol, for women, idk bout men cuz I'm not a man
maybe I'll ask my guy friends

i'm actually curious now

hahahah
hmm, male kpop tends to go a more androgenous aesthetic though
idk, i don't like categorizing looks

omg
the politically-correct part of me jumped out for a second ‎<This message was edited>

idk bout the physique, they are never shirtless, it's not allowed
they literally starve themselves to be lean ‎<This message was edited>

and I do that, but still gain weight

i think my body has become so energy efficient that I am taking energy from hydrogen in the air

ok
I _am_ craving a treat right now
bunbun, I might sleep early today pq I can't keep my eyes open

yep! I read bout them. Apparently they are very common

I think Sirius is a binary star né

I was reflecting, and you honestly helped me make so much progress on my one goal this year (and every year), bettering myself as a person.
hehe, I hope it's not cringe

Lied about sleeping
Playing Chinese poker with my mom and sister

Just won
And I didn’t even know how to play

Damnn, living the dream!

That’s the best kinda of goals

hmm

Speaking of addiction

oo this one is hardd
haha ja com porra

ooh i misread
lmao

‎image omitted

now i'm a little horny
anyways

if i have time to pick some up before i leave, i wanna have you try them
they are sooo good

my body is so considerate
it heard I was might get you dick, and was like i got you girl
what i'm trying to say is i started my period

fascinating

at this point, why make nouns gendered
it would make my life a lot easier
like why is "dia" masc

except me

i'm so special

Haha ‎<This message was edited>

Lol

might go out to have breakfast
but rn I'm just trying to get out of bed
what are you doing? are you staying up

what does your fam do in the mean time?

my sister kept complaining that tea time and talking was boring
what why🥺

awwwwww

yeah you know why
cuz she wanted to use her ipad

hahhahahah
i was having a great time

hahahha
this might be a trend, cuz my sister didn't ask about you either
hey i would like me too if I saw that

i'm glad you like it hehe

what is she talking about
You have so much charisma
and you are undoubtedly funny

maybe she just has unconventional standards

really? Why does that happen

It’s ok to not understand someone’s humor, but doesn’t make sense to say someone sucks at humor just cuz you don’t understand

lol, they prob just have a skewed perception of you
Ignore this text ‎<This message was edited>
Dont feel sad bunbun, you have a great personality
And all your friends knows it too

yeah I get that

I know you want people you care about to have a good image of you
I do too

Yeah…it is something you can’t control
so don’t stress too much about it since you can’t control it. Just be you and see if she comes around
I sure even if she thinks you are grumpy and immature, she still loves you the way you are

That’s just an unfair burden to put on you
Oh hey, happy new year bunbun!

Hug hug
I hope you feel better about this
I’m sorry if I didnt do a great job at listening

How are you feeling my lovely puppy?

Bom dia!

It is much too early rn pra mim

Haha, I forgot to check the time when and woke up
But I heard birds chirping, so I decided good enough

Nope, I watched like the first 5-10 min of each vid

Cuz some of them weren’t that interest to me. Imma watch the fishing one though

Yeah I found out a lot of new info
and the existence of mods
Lol why did I assume he was gonna play 24 continuous hours

I just fell back sleep and had 2 dreams about you

1. Extremely realistic, I woke up panicking thinking it was real
You texted me on whatsapp saying hey let’s call at 6:30 cuz I have to tell you about me day. You said you saw puppies and traveled internationally

So when I woke up and saw it was 7 I was like oh shit
2. We were back in Stanford. You told me you’ll be coming to donner at 6 or something
I was hanging out with one of my highschool teachers in branner and missed the time

and you were upset. I remember you asking do you even love me…and I thinking how it doesn’t sound like something you would say
But I ws panicking so i didn’t think hard about that
I found you in branner’s cybercafé and luckily you forgave me and we played a game similar to it takes two
The end
All that in an hour
No idea, you were gonna tell me in the call
Haha, no logic in dreams

Hahhaha, no? Not even if I offered to show you how sorry I was ‎<This message was edited>

Watching your instagram reels rn
the new year is funny, cuz that’s what I did lmao

You can do both at the same time?

Yeah I wanna talk with you

Forgive my dishevaled look though, I’m still in bed

legit, just physically tired, almost skipped gym today and it was only shoulders

btw, off topic, do you have a brokerage account in the U.S
ahh i find it so much harder to go to the gym by myself

and I'm just starring at the wall during rests

lmaooo

yeah, having a U.S. brokerage account will solve my tiredness
naooo
I actually prefer just zoning out...maybe my youtube vids are just all trash

either I lose cuddling time, or feel stupid

I'll take the bet

a lot better
you always manage to cheer me up
I wish I had the same success

I'm trying and improving I hope

ok, as long as you feel better

I’m still thinking lol

You are right, it’s nothing but cute
I think you meant to say
Anything but cute

But I disagree with the second

Se lá, doesn’t make you any less cute and pretty

Well it’s doesn’t for me

Yeah I do

Idk what you want me to say

‎sticker omitted
No you arent
I get how you feel. I would feel the same way in your position
In fact, I probably would be panicking. But really, from my point of view, you still look cute af ‎<This message was edited>

And I wanna hug you
So I could grab that ass

Just give it a bit more time

‎image omitted

Bom dia!
Tudo bem?
I’m in such a good mood right now. Just had a 3 hour convo with my mom, after spending an afternoon with her ‎<This message was edited>

We talked about everything. Gossip bout my cousin, jobs, interviews, relationships, my sister, etc

I ate snacks while talking and now I’m bout to throw up
how you feeling?

hey you tell me more about your “ok” first
I’ll tell you one fact bout each section if you want

My cousin refuses to learn anything new (e.g. he throws away his undergarments instead of learning how to wash them)

Job and interview: my mom gave me some advice in terms of how to interview and her job seeking process
21
Fun fact, my cousin and I share the same birthday

Yeah, but I don’t think it’ll be helpful cuz it’s customized for my introverted ass

Bruh don’t even get me started 🙄

It’s pretty basic advice like just try to interview as much as you can, even if you don’t want the job, so you can get a hang of what questions they ask…how to tell a story productively…
And say you are proficient at a skill they ask for even if you aren’t lol

Fuck no

I don’t like talking to strangers and I don’t like talking about myself

Haha awww that’s so kind of you ‎<This message was edited>

Im really flattered you think so…not sure where you got that impression though
Its a very important skill, and I need to get better at it
Anyways here comes the bomb of the conversion

It’s in the relationship section

Awww thank you. I really like it when people like my writing or think my advice helps their writing
My mom is like…so you should think carefully bout marriage. I’m like yeah I know. And then seconds later, hey you should have a kid while you are young
Where am I getting this kid 😂😂

Yeah she really wants me to have a child for some reason. But I think she is slightly delusional
Ok last section.
My sister made me the cutest gift ever

‎image omitted

You might think it looks trash but omg I love it sooooo much

And the story behind it as well
well idk, I took a pretty bad photo of it
I think she even tried to draw mushrooms but gave up hahaha

More details?

I don’t remember how we got into the topic
Omg i doooo

Kazel’s mom asked my mom “hey did you know Fiona’s got a boyfriend”

And my mom’s like “no shit, of course”
Actually, if I say anything to a Chinese person, I first ask myself if I’ll be ok with the entirety of China knowing

And then we talked about our (my) ideas of a healthy relationship, my worries, and how I date for long term commitment…
And then I asked her about her and dad

And then she turned it back on me
This is more of an in-person topic in my mind

Talk in person

So she said “kids?” Me: “Right now? Not before 30 I think, more stability then”
“No no, you should do it in your 20s”
“Delusional you are. Look at the economic climate” ‎<This message was edited>

Haha she had me in her late 20. That’s why she wants me to do the same

I know ri-
Ok
Hahah
I do have to say there was a slight blunder in my beginning years

Bruh they no offense but my parents where not ready to be parents loll
In my humble opinion
Ok I’m about to over share
So imma put a pause on this convo

Ok
My mom didn’t even want a child
But she got pregnant and was like fuck it we ball

So I was mostly raised by my grandparents
And so when I said “no child in 20s” she was like you can give your kid to me
And my life (no lie) flashed before my eyes

I was like absolutely not. Not repeating that mistake

That’s what I want for my kid as well. If I have a kid, I want them to feel so secure about my love and care for them

this is a serious topic

Idk if I wanna keep talking bout it right now

Yep, I concur.
So anyways, how do you marry someone in stardew valley?

I want to have a kid while my character is still in her 20s
and give it to the dad who keeps sending me money in the mail box ‎<This message was edited>

Yess

No way

Is the game not gonna allow me to have a kid?

meh, the game needs to catch up. IVF is all the hype right now

It’s when you fertilize an egg outside of body

What story
Hahahah

Wait wait I’m actually so curious now

When you ask your parents where babies/you come from, what did they say?
I never heard this story. My mom told me I came from a trashcan

Hahahahha
That was good

Is that what your parents told you? The plant story? ‎<This message was edited>

Yeah me too.
I think I just found my next book to read

‎image omitted
The book is kinda obscure I think. Red Doc> by Anne Carson.

‎image omitted
But I need your help

The code is also taking out all the black (like my hair) because I’m  only keeping pixels that do not have blue over a certain value ‎<This message was edited>

Yes that was my consideration as well
But I’m kinda confused how the colors work

average = (pixel.red + pixel.green + pixel.blue) / 3
this is what they showed us in class

this is my code, but the average thing is what they showed in class

yes for removing a blue bg
i think the problem is that my hair looks blue

Ok it’s working

But idk why

i just increased
to like 1.6

can you help me understand why though?

lolll ok

‎image omitted

if pixel.blue <= average * 1.6:
this is provided code

Do you remember the multiplication chart better in English or Portuguese

Oh my
I think I remember them as sounds
I have the same problem with Pi, I can only recite in Chinese
This is interesting

I wonder what caused this difference in perception

I think it’s my lack of…comprehension?

True true
Hmm imma research this
Fascinating

Oh cool! didn’t know this was a function
cute of you to do this

Ok lemme change my settings
Should work now

It looks like white chocolate. I am drooling

I think it’s depends on the age group.
For example, if you have a stable life at 30, 2 years is an acceptable time to consider marriage. But if you are younger, more time wouldn’t hurt

What are your thoughts
Can you specify what you mean by optimal?

Woah, that makes it very clear
Hmm

Hahah
Man this is complicated, I don’t think a general solution is going to work for this function
But if I had to throw out a number based on feeling, I would say ~4
You?

That answer is based on feeling
No calculations

🤯

I’m heading over rn
Wanna meet me in the middle?
Here

Idk

‎image omitted

I’ll let you know if I found out where that’s happening
Class today was so interesting
I found out the reason why when you add floats in python, it gives a slightly off value

Because computers store the floats as binary, which gets truncated if it’s too long ‎<This message was edited>
and so, the error happens during the conversion between base 2 and base 10: it uses the truncated binary representation to do calculations, and then coverts the result to base 10 ‎<This message was edited>
We used Taylor series to do the conversion, so freaking cool

Give me some credit, it’s hard to be wrong *all* the time as well

Oopsie

Damn you changed the date for me??
I think the Monday one works as well

I prefer the weekend one. I’m not sure when housing is gonna open yet, because they haven’t released that info

Also bunbun, I will be purchasing the flight ticket after I get my visa

yes

I will buy the ticket if it has no cancellation fee. Leticia hasn’t responded to that question yet

Yes

Btw, if Leticia doesn’t respond by tonight, can you check for me (on their website maybe?) if they have cancellation fees?

thank you bunbun <3

‎image omitted

Yeah I like it

Ooo I thought it was because you were near boats

Lol, even if you double knot it?

Interesting thought
That you had an internal clock

For a little bit in kindergarten, I could cry every time I woke up from a nap
I’m glad you grew out of it

Well, it’s def better than my kindergarten, cuz the teacher there didn’t care I was crying. But I think you would

awww 🥺 I want a hug

I almost had dinner with Hazel today
But alas, she eludes me
(which I predicted)

She flaked

Hahahahhha

Traveling is always tiring

His intonation is very distinct

You dare call me a liar?
You may challenge my subjectivity, but not my belief

‎sticker omitted

Yes

I do think that about you

maybe not objectively true for everyone, but it’s true for me

No

You can think what you think as long as you still love me for who I am

That’s a totally ok mindset to have

but I would really prefer one thing though 👀
I’m still a bit insecure in my appearance. It will get better, but right now it’s not. So please don’t make too realistic a comment about it lol

Hahaha
Ok that made me feel good bout myself

‎sticker omitted

oh, I agree

I might talk with my mom about it
But I think once I start making my own income, I will definitely get a therapist

Yea bunbun? ‎<This message was edited>

thank you. I think I will see that eventually. It has already gotten so much better because of your encouraging words

Oh no

Mouth wounds tend to heal very fast

Aww poor bunbun, I have some medicine for this if it still hurts tmr

Ha! I like
but no, it’s this bitter tasting powder
I’m sorry but I am so horny for you

🫣 okie

What does this mean?

I’ll try my best!
Wow, I hope I don’t get blown away

Wait for me?

Loll engineering brain
It’s true 😔

Hey it’s sleepy time bunbun, let’s put the screens away and get under the covers? Say “good night, phone!”

Because I was about to say me too
But my mind was like no that’s a kid you are talking to
Lmaoo so strange, the feeling ‎<This message was edited>

I love you too, hope you have a good night

I’m very happy you like it because I love saying it to you

We can find one together
Yours come from a very spontaneous experience

It was an evening, we were walking to branner and there were two rabbits on the lawn.

You started to sing the bunny song that is a word play on the word ass I think?
yep

haha cute
Airdropping you a good night kiss

A little?
Not sure what I’m feeling
Are you not?

Nothing, I just can’t tell how im feeling sometimes
Its not bad

Hot strange I hope ;)

Fuck why is this actually good

lmao you know me too well

I’m flattered that you spent effort to understand me 🥺
Means a lot to me

Hahahaha
I like this summary
hmm you know what, I think I’m actually feeling uncomfortable
from dinner

I ate too much

I have been
I only over ate cuz I was so hungry

Loll

Man is deranged 😂

Don’t think it’s a good idea in reality. Because one, dish washer’s not the most hygienic place to store plates (clean or dirty)
And also dish washers are huge, takes up too much place.

It’ll only be worth it if you need to run it every day
Loll because for one second I was like hmmm plausible idea

: 0
We better be adopting 8 then

0 :

Oo I like this idea a lot
Sound amazing

Are we doing that today?

Tell me about it

Same, it’s like saying hey where is the end of the snake. You would point to it’s tail

Oh I see, he is looking at it from a-person-in-the-line perspective
And I see it as a person outside the line
Interesting!

Maybe! I think you’ve seen that reel about how different languages think of time as moving in different directions?

Yeah, your dad’s perspective is def unique

I think like 95% of people would say end of line is at the tail

Haha I feel like you say that for every game ;)
I don’t feel like going to gym today

But I already skipped yesterday 😭😭

oo ok ok!
Lemme know if y’all plan to drive to campus

7/10, did you forget the actress’ name?

ah I just ate brunch :(
Yay!!

Nah, that’s a little awkward for me Im sorry
I would be happy to join y’all for dinner

Oh bunbun, brunch ends 1:30

Portugese

so before today, the really advanced student ask if I were gonna use the tutor service. I said I will, when my boyfriend gets too annoyed with me talking with him

And today, I said “eu vou almoçar com meu amigo)
and the prof was like meu amigo? Or meu _amigo_

And I was so shocked that I started laughing
Yes

And the advanced student was like oh well ela tem…and I said sim, tenho namorado
Ziyad

Do I have to say tenho um namorado?
He didn’t

Hahahahha
I didn’t get to that
Maybe next time
👆

Do I need um in that sentence?

Asked where you were from, and why my speaking and listening still sucks ass ‎<This message was edited>

Haha no of course not

No no, he was just like you should practice with him everyday to make up for the gap between me and Spanish speakers

The students have learned the value of protesting, and they have that passion, but they don’t seem to transform that passion into meaningful discussions ‎<This message was edited>

Which may be more proactive for both sides, both in terms of Pal and Isr, and student and university I think
Loll I just thought it was really eye opening

Bunbun, Do you remember much about Lagrange multipliers? ‎<This message was edited>

Im stuck on a sorta theoretic question

Okie! Thanks bunbun
‎image omitted
‎image omitted
I can easily find a point on F (that’s also on the surface) that has a bigger value
But idk why it implies that f has no global extrema then

Ok, so what are the points that I found?

They must be critical points no?

Yes, so I guess I found some local extremas then?
Im not sure how to explain it

Oh and the maximum doesn’t exist
I see!
Wait
But the minimum also doesn’t exist

Yes

Ok I see!
Thank you bunbun
You are so smart <3

‎sticker omitted
‎This message was deleted.

Yeah but the problem was that

The points weren’t maximums nor minimums
So they just seemed like two random points
So I was like what the hell did Lagrange do

We can see. Maybe it can be our rest day instead

True true, we can go in the evening maybe
bunbun, what’s the plan for your night? 👀
i.e. should I bring my stuff when I come over for suits?
Hey bunbun, are you alright?

uh when do you want me to come over
Are you busy tonight?

I’ll be there soon
Im here. Please bring Ferdinand

I feel bad that Ellen has to go through this
I think if she specifically wants to know about his last relationship, you could direct her to ask the person you heard it and from
Like “I think xxx knows more about this”

I personally wouldn’t deliver such second-hand information

But more importantly, bunbun I love you so much too
And I’m horny for you (as always)

Also, someone in my ling class got married :0

No idea. She’s prob a grad or phd student thought
No way she’s a junior

Eventually ;

I think I’m busy, how bout this afternoon?

The people who can make it will make it, and those who don’t don’t
I’ll give you a coupon

Fuck
‎sticker omitted
This was all a trick to get a coupon 😭

aw bunbun I’m sorry you feel anxious
I will help you, don’t worry
My bunbun is the best

I want to give you a hug. I have felt something similar
I’m sorry bunbun

It’s not your fault bunbun
There is no fault here

It’s just an obstacle
That we will get over. Just like all the other ones
You are incredibly smart
it’s ok to feel stupid, but you are far from stupid

Apparently it’s someone’s birthday party??
I’m less inclined to go now…

Not particularly
I’m so bad at archery lolll
So more info: there’s a waitlist, but Michael says it doesn’t matter. It’s also “formal wear”

Are you sure? Don’t let me stop you. If you want to go, I will go with yog

Sounds amazing
I’m really looking forward
Especially the
Essay part

Omg só cute
But Ferdinand looks 100 years old

Hahahahah so cute I love these so much

Aww Bunbun I’m sorry

I should’ve stayed with you

I want to understand more
What triggered this feeling

I feel you bunbun

I will always be here for you, and I have no doubt that you will find more friend who can hang out with you

I think some things just take time, and in the mean time, we can discover some new hobbies ‎<This message was edited>

I felt a similar way a few days before

It’s what you are used to, and it’s uncomfortable to try new things

It is not
I promise on Ferdinand that it will not, I will help you, and your friends, and your therapist will help you figure something out
I thought I would never ever get over my body dysmorphia ‎<This message was edited>
But I’m getting better after I found the right method

I get you. My advisor told me the same thing about the difficulty of making friends among the faculty
But ‎<This message was edited>
It’s not every friend
Really. You are such a fun person to be around with, and you have social hobbies
You will always have a community

Awww that’s cute
Maybe we can come up with our own version
Btw bunbun, do you like coconut stuff?

Ok
I might get something for you

Bro I was reading the comments
And one was like “is there an alternative to sleep, cuz I’ve been intolerant after having a kid”
And my brain just went chatgpt mode
With your research topic
sleep and wellness->new parents and their sleep->maternity leave->productivity and capitalism

I know

It’s just an idea ‎<This message was edited>

But it always ends up around capitalism
And it stops there cuz I know shit about Econ and politics

Wtf lmaoo

Picking at 3
But you can look at availability before hand
I’m deciding between stern:Twain and Wilbur:junípero

Yeah I was looking at the floor plans and
It’s just like donner

I heard Sally ride conditions are not great

Oh bunbun,
When you pick rooms, you have to pick the specific room
So if you care, take a look at the floor plan
in case you don’t want a room near the bathroom (cuz you’ll be hearing flushing 24/7
I picked first floor Twain btw

108
what’s up

Aww that would be great

Eu vou te ajudar
Don’t worry

fico muito feliz _por conversar_ com você em português

this makes sense?!

Que o que?

Eu adoraria conhecer mais do Bunbun brasileiro

Grande parte?

Hahahah

hahahah, come on, you know I think about you and your dick 24/7
and your ass, and you cute smile, and your caring side, and your loving side only I get to see

Parece bom!
Eu estou lendo o quadrinho sobre da mage
Você também consegue compartilhar seu draft comigo

ok, manga

Yay!!! I’ll read it after my office hour

Yeah! I know it as Pastel de Nata
It spread to Macau and Hongkong

KFC used to sell it

And I was obsessed

but my parents didn’t let me eat it lol
Have you had them  in Brazil?
Hey bunbun, could you grab an apple for me in Arrilaga por favor?

Oh cool! Is he on the other side of your room?

Haha

Oh! A person in Terra also said that when I said I live in donner
Is that what you will host instead of game nights now?
Bunbun, lemme know when you wanna hang out

‎image omitted

Coming
Here

‎image omitted

Yeah I’m missing my lecture lol

I really like it
And I’m super hungry

Didn’t understand shit

Yeah, but no idea what it was about
Maybe about a wedding of some sort
Hahhaha it was fun
And awkward. But everyone was awkward, so it was fun

Yeah!

If you can call it dancing lol

It was a mess lol
The organization
But whatever, it was fun

Despite the popular belief that prioritizing sleep is a sign of laziness, scientific evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation has significant negative effects on physical and mental well-being; thus, we must reframe our understanding of sleep as a vital component of productivity
Instead of it’s enemy

Bunbun I don’t wanna walk back to branner

I love you too
I’m sorry I made you sad, I will not do this next time and stick to my plans

I didn’t want to walk alone back to branner

I also thought you would come with me

I just didn’t expect that you didn’t want to come with me
for some reason, I was surprised

Yeah but I didn’t leave my stuff at donner because I planned to sleep at donner
I left my stuff when I ate lunch cuz my bag was heavy
And I left the food cuz distance

And I just didn’t bring them with me to the game

That’s what I always do
Cuz I brush my teeth in the middle of the day
And sometimes I need my makeup bag

Oh it’s good that you did

Also, I’m very sorry to keep talking about this but I’m gonna explode if I don’t say it

We never made a plan; you never asked where I would be sleeping tonight. You made an assumption that I would sleep here tonight

Yeah, best to keep a reminder on google

Yeah but that’s not the focus. You accused (sorry for the word choice) me of not telling you again
when no plan was made in the first place ‎<This message was edited>

We are talking about different points. I admit that cancelling last minute was my mistake. But I am also saying that you accuse me of not communicating with you, when you also made the assumption that I would sleep over when you never asked me
But I don’t think this is productive to talk about anymore

I’m talking about the moment
When you accused me not commicating with you, when I said I will have to grab things from donner

It’s ok. Let’s put a pause on this. I don’t want to upset you any more ‎<This message was edited>
have a good night, I love you ‎<This message was edited>
I’m sorry for how I handled things tonight and getting argumentative over such small things

I love you too, and I want to be a plus to your life

Ok bunbun
‎image omitted

Good try!

Yay! Hope you get a good one
We should go to Angel Island together sometime

Ah, it’s well know for its beach and hiking trails
People usually camp there lol. Just thought it sounded fun

!! Aww
I will do some more research and we can decide if we wanna go!

God I love having Ferdinand with me
and I love having you by my side, both in spirit and physically
Hey bunbun, I left my grey jacket on your bed. Could you bring it to the gym?

Ok, heading to stern

I found my water bottle 😭😭
So happy

That’s sounds great!
Aww thank you bunbun, I will prepare them

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7cjOlMu-oD/?igsh=NjFhOGMzYTE3ZQ==

Bro he actually slapped him

Hahahah
Cute
That’s sweet of you
Well now I want to read her essay

Hmm hmm

Oh nice! What did you come up with

Hmm, but if someone is insecure about their appearance, wouldn’t being called pretty be the novel experience instead?
I still remember when you told me you thought I was pretty, and it being shocking to me ‎<This message was edited>

Yeah maybe like the human brain likes to hear thing that affirm beliefs it already has

Hahaha thank you

‎sticker omitted

hooking 😂, am I nautilus

You played him I think

Yep, the big guy
hook and smash

Yeah it’s something you can address. Maybe connecting with the section about quality over quantity, you can include some factual tips. ‎<This message was edited>
I don’t think it’s necessary though, because your focus is about telling people the way we are thinking about sleep is wrong

How to sleep is a lesser focus

However, if she has this feeling, that means we have made out point unclear

Then you can add it and we can see how it feels

Yes that is possible as well

I just don’t want to distract from our argument
Maybe include it in the conclusion then

Sounds good!
‎image omitted

Right now, I can only think to add to the paragraph about what a society with a correct view of sleep would look like

That’s fine
It’s not a point you wanted to make

What’s this for?

I dont see a place for it now
but i also haven’t reread your paper yet so

I would suggest reading your paper like you’ve never seen it before
And ask questions about it

haha come on
You are doing a great job on your first rba
Bunbun, you got plans for dinner?
Oh Bun~bun~

Oop sorry

I’m dipping early from mine
Just wanted to ask for dinner plan
But I guess you already ate?

Here

Obrigada bunbun <3
Eu tenho Ferdinand comigo
então tudo vai ficar bem

Done
Ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhh

‎image omitted

‎Voice call, ‎17 sec

fuck I’m sorry bunbun

It will be ok

Maybe talk with your ta or prof about it
it’s ok bunbun. It happens to everyone
hug hug

Aw bunbun, I feel you
It will be ok. We can afford mistakes with no problem right now ‎<This message was edited>

I know it feels bad
I did the same shit in 21 and almost in 51 again

Is your grading for homework only 80%?
We don’t have a drop for 51 and 21

But if you get 80% of possible points, it counts as 100

ah
I really hope your TA will give you a chance to make it up
But having no drop is ridiculous

Yayyyyyyyy
‎sticker omitted

Lol I would just thank T^2 and his crystal ball

After 2 I’m pretty free

Okie!

Sounds good
So we are married in Agripino’s class ‎<This message was edited>

If possible
And then I will grab your ice cream and coke for us

I got a bite of chicken nuggets at the soap

Ahh yeah i think using the retainer you have now is a good idea
Does it hurt when you put the retainer in?
You should get a few duplicates when you go back to Brasil

Ok, hopefully it will move stuff back in place
Ah my dentist told me retainers were…a forever thing
But the later on, you can go a while without them
Idk why, but my teeth still shifts if I don’t use it
God, I still get butterflies for you
I was flipping through my photos and saw one of us in October

Awwwwww
I’m on a call with my mom rn
Chatting bout you haha

I told her bought our date
and she’s asking bout our summer plans
And she’s asking me to reflect why you picked me

To support her argument to why being “fun” is important

Hehe because you are always funny

awwww

I’m so glad you like my silly side

hahaha I love our plushies
I’m very in love with you bunbun

Aww bunbun, I hope you get some good sleep on the plane
Lol, a lot of other stuff
I will text you after I finish

All good thing

Ok I’m done
so one thing she mentioned was like not being too aggressive with you, like pressuring you to do things my way
And I was like, uhhhh too late

and she always talks about us as if we are one unit already
it was just that, just like an advice

Like she always says “you two”
and she talked about how cost efficient being a couple is
Cuz instead of buying two rice cookers, we can just buy one
Lmaoo
and she asked how it feels to have a boyfriend for almost a year
and I said it’s amazing, which she used as an opportunity to say “and you wanted to find a woman”
So basically, the same old topics

But this call was cool cuz my entire fam was eating lunch

So I got to see everyone
Hahahah, too bad you aren’t getting rid of me anytime soon
I already miss our nights together

Oh..to me it seemed like you just disappeared, cuz you didn’t say bye or anything
I’m glad you enjoyed the game!

I didn’t know you would leave the call before I finished, and I thought if you did, you would text me bye
So to me, it was very abrupt and silent. That’s all I’m saying.

It’s ok

‎sticker omitted

You are gonna make me cry
‎sticker omitted

You are already helping me a ton with that

It’s a lengthy process, but I will get there
You are so considerate of me
I am incredibly touched and grateful for how great of a partner you are
I want to help you become the best version of yourself as well

Cuz it might make me happy in the future
loll

Yeah that’s my fear

Do you appreciate yourself bunbun?

You are right bunbun

How did this happen. You just decided one day?

So hot
How can you have such a hot butt when you don’t even work out glutes huh

I *love* your ass

Bunbun
Every time I see your dick
I want to put in my mouth

Cuz I like it so much

It varies greatly
but usually in the morning 6:30
Or night after 6

No
Do you?

Yes

Hahhahaha
Of course bunbun

And for you, it’s on the house

Hehe
You are really trying to keep me horny 24/7

I want you to fuck me soo bad

Every night before I sleep I think about you, and then I get horny. Very counterproductive

I will try

Yessir
I want to

But I have to get over being uncomfortable with my body

‎sticker omitted

Of course bunbun

I’m talking bout you with my mom right now lol

Damn! I wanna earn 200k

You mean you were hoping your future partner in general makes 200k?
Me confused
Btw you know the girl who’s thinking of switching universities to be with her bf

Ohh I see
‎sticker omitted

hahaha

she picked the worse uni

Yeah…and she picked a very unusual major

And you don’t change majors in China
It’s actually quite sad
I don’t think she has a good relationship with her parents

horticulture?

yeah
But side note
I despise her dad

He is vain and thinks he is super high ranking in life just cause he is high ranked professionally

But mainly, because during a dinner with him, he kept encouraging my dad to drink hard liquor
And the end result was terrible, and scared my sister a lot

It is so common

the drinking culture is terrible
‎sticker omitted

I’m glad bunbun

It’s true

Yes it is

It’s just like smoking and drugs to me

Damn that got me worked up
I’m gonna head to gym now

I’ve been procrastinating

beber água
oh they have, it’s in the dispenser near the tissues

We can role play

Depends on how much they keep pushing I suppose

I think it’s most productive to lie

Heath condition, medicine interference, pregnancy, just becoming sober

I think you should try the pregnancy one

Fuck mean people :(

I can be mean to you

Ok…😔

‎sticker omitted

My ass is always horny when it comes to you

Awww

I won’t stop working then

I don’t think I will to be honest

I want to be traveling around and do fun stuff with you when we are older

Yes
Hahahah
Not if I do it first

Imma spend it on 4 giant plushies
Boom, no more money

That’s the difference. I’m not sure wh

Lmaooooo

Hahah no
I think it’s just that, specifically ‎<This message was edited>
It’s a power dynamic thing I believe

I like you in control
But it’s not like a must, just a preference

It’s embarrassing to talk about, but I’m trying to get over it
Because I trust you

Yes
‎sticker omitted

Bunbun, you are such a great partner
I hope you can feel the same way about me

‎sticker omitted

I do realize that

I will work on taking complaints with more grace
I think it’s because i want to be perfect for you, and it makes me irrationally sad, when the reality is I can’t be

Bruh the LinkedIn endorsement 🥰
Also the painting is fire

Hahahha

Me on the hip thrust machine
Wasted boba, that’s a crime

Bunbun time

It’s such a wonderful feeling, getting to know another human and making a friend
If all human interactions were so comfortable, I wouldn’t be an introvert
I had a great conversation with Jordan
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8t1_sjIOVN/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Literally my bunbun https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8rVbm7IQhv/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

You just made me laugh in the gym

Damn you just elevated my mood
What’s up

Awww

There’s an infinite supply when I’m with you. Don’t worry

Aww. I love you laugh as well. It makes me so happy
And you look so pretty when you laugh
The way your eyes look

‎image omitted

The video 😟
It’s interesting, but I think any old towel would work as well no?
‎image omitted
I miss you I need you

Ah that’s a little scary
But I can understand her
Cuz I am afraid of elevators
And if a kid is jumping around in there

I would be very anxious

Hmhm, sometimes we have bad days
I’m sorry to detract from the topic
But a time sensitive question, does you mom like flowers or nah
I know right!

I’m trying to buy crochet yarn for the flowers gift
what colors do they like
fuck do I need to bring something for your aunt
Omg your family is too big lolll ‎<This message was edited>

it’s fine, I’ll just make my best guess

Heheh
My bunbun is smoking hot
I fear i can’t do three crochets in time (and I would have to put yours on hold)

I’m actually getting stressed

Aww thank you bunbun
It’s just, I would feel so uncomfortable if I don’t bring things

Lol yeah I’ll have to do that

Why did I pick a time consuming art form lol
Hahahahah
I suppose

If it’s on you, I would take it

A great size to fit in my mouth
Yumyum

Idk why but my anxiety is not disappearing, since last night

literally nothing, it’s just a physical feeling
Uncomfortable though, like my skin feels too tight and my heart beat is high
Fun times, it’s getting better though

Omg quail eggs, so cute
Bunbun you know what I just realized about my diet recently?

I saw the rice, and I was like oh that’s an unusual way to eat it
Because I haven’t eaten plain rice in a long time
But I’m literally Chinese. Plain rice is suppose to be our thing
Bruh I love cute foods. Put some eyes on my broccoli, and suddenly I don’t dislike broccoli anymore

I wish I could eat something (or someone) cute rn

It’s true

the logic is logicing
Awww
I love you bunbun

Hahaha

Ew
The você is strange

Hehe I know

I was just being mean to you
There is this instagram account of a bunny
And everyday, they add a new carrot on top of it, and it’s the funnest thing ever
‎image omitted
Bunbunn
eu quero te ver
Yes people love the number 8, and 6, because of their “meaning”
I feel like Chinese people love using numbers to represent words
5201314
That’s a sentence. I just said: I will love you for the rest of my life ‎<This message was edited>

Pets are a little dirty

One stinky bunbun is enough for me
and maybe a few stinky Ferdinands

Yessir

And you are the best partner for me

Gosh Ferdinand is looking so cute as well rn

I thought they shat themselves 😭
I was like why would they eat a laxative before minigolf

Nope
Is it like viagra

I don’t think I need it lolll

Haha sounds like a good time

I feel like it might be placebo

People are saying the taste is bad

But if you want, we can try

lol you were gonna eat it without me

Bruh so pretty https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8fPDayPJ5C/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Literally described how I found you. Eye catching on the outside, and even more shockingly beautiful on the inside. Also smelly, like the lily https://www.instagram.com/reel/C86o3BrNg0y/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Ha I thought you would pick that
Hahah you know what’s sadder. In Shanghai, companies use the drones to make a giant QR code in the sky
And when you scan it, it’s an ad
What’s happening here?
That’s just called adhering to the beauty standard. Idk about the marriage one tho
Hahahahha
I like this one

Bunbun you good?

‎Video call, ‎10 min

Alright, sorry for a bad call
everything is you https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7L6eLAP3ue/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Hey bunbun
I understand how you feel. We can switch things up a bit

It’s ok to feel this way. But you will feel better if we find something for you to do and enjoy as well

you could call your friends this weekend and chat
Or would you considered flying back earlier ‎<This message was edited>

Why won’t it help being back home?

I know it’s hard, but you can always decide to do something, something to occupy your time

Maybe nothing you want to do
But there’s many things you can do

I would say just give them a try, try them with me
It’s just to take your mind off of feeling…purposeless? I’m not sure if that’s the right word

Teach me 106B
lol
Or learn something, like I’m planning to learn how to do case interviews ‎<This message was edited>
But I also need motivation

It’s hard, it’s new, I don’t wanna do it
Let’s just sit down, and do 10 minutes of it
Tomorrow
It sounds hard, but we can do it together. Just like a hard leg workout
It’s really not that bad once we start
And you will feel better afterwards

It’s ok bunbun

I want to hug you through it
Try talking about it with your aunt tonight ‎<This message was edited>
I also felt similarly today, and was about to cry
It’s a very strange time right now. It’s the first time we’ve been away from college in the summer

And you’re family is going through a big change

and we won’t. I will make sure we won’t

I think a lot of people are feeling the same way

I was talking with Blair, and she also had this strange feeling of either doing mind numbing work or doing nothing
But we are the only ones who can change this feeling

they isn’t gonna be someone to save us from it
Is it. We just have to find it again
god I wish I could be a good therapist

The only thing I can do, is be with you and help you figure it out together
but I can’t solve the issue

Of course not bunbun, we are just having a conversation
And it’s helpful to voice your true feelings
Maybe you will realize something you didn’t before

I understood nothing, yet somehow understood everything
Hahah it looks so hype

You always make my day better bunbun

Awww
Hehe we really are a power couple

What’d ya get

Yumyum

I’m glad bunbun
I hope you feel even better after a good sleep

Hahaha

Ya I’m also blaming my sleep quality on the lack of my stinky bunbun
:0

yeah i miss you scaring the fuck out of me with your twitches ‎<This message was edited>

Hahahahah

Hahaha the cold ass wall
But what about me hugging you from behind
Me sleeping snuggled on your chest
Me turning on the fan and handing you your charger

Why do I prefer the first dude’s look more
Wait is it the same person

But when do you wanna play?
Should I get brunch first?
And when can I see my bunbun’s face

To train a beefalo

Boobies

Yayyy, im so happy for bunbun
Who cares, you form is amazing
The only thing that’s embarrassing is seeing someone with big weights and ridiculous form

Bunbunnn
Comparing yourself with another only makes you have irrational expectations for yourself
And forget how far you’ve come
I’m betting you
That there are people who wish to squat how much you are squaring now

Lmaoo
Bunbun 😫
You are strong
And beautiful
Who cares how many extra plates you can add, I wanna see them doing as many weighted pull ups as you can do

Bunbunnnnnn ‎<This message was edited>
I wish I could make you feel better

Yeah we can!
I also want to travel with you. I know you’ve been wanting to do that :]

Me neither bunbun, it’s just not something my family prioritizes
but thinking about how you will enjoy it, it makes me excited ‎<This message was edited>

I will! We will plan it well

Of course, it’s with my bunbun

On a serious note, I think I think about you every other second
Omg the hip thrust made me tear up

Sorry were you gonna say something

That’s a hard one, I’ll lookup what couples call each other

Awwwwwww
我也很爱你

That’s me saying I love you too
the “too” is another word

It would work

Lemme take a listen, I got interrupted

I saw a Reddit post about a person falling for gpt, because it was their only source of comfort
wo he ni hen what?
I couldn’t hear the word

Ohhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhh
I hear it I hear it

The first part is great
Its not, I just have to get used to the way you speak

Did you say you wanted to eat something not good?

I hear wo hao chi
hao chi is right
I was a bit confused by wo

Haha I loved it

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8_8MGQJlWf/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Yes! your sentences about coffee and tea I understood the first listen

Hahahah, well guì is a word I use often

When I talk about qián, its mostly me talking about how wǒ méi qián ( I don’t have money)
Nope, guí is only expensive

Cheap is another word. Or you can say bú guì (not expensive)

It means not having something, lacking something
Oh sorry I didn’t see the bú

:0
It feels like, you just called me incapable of love ‎<This message was edited>

Haha, a different word might be better

Oh you can do a lot of damage
Your vocab is small but deadly, like an elite task force lol

like the English word may

But with a rising tone

I didn’t make my guess yet bunbun

That was me responding to your questions about pronounciatikn
I want your ass pleaseeee
Give me another chance

I knew that

Interesting

Will I get another chance?

You just dangled what felt like 1 billion dollars in front of my face
Naooooooo

Bunbun, you are being unfair with me 😫
Vai tomar no cu cara

What can I say, I just felt a need to say it
How can I
When I almost got your ass
On a platter
I just had to say micro empreendedor individual

Sounds like goo-ay in English, spoken in one syllable
Rhymes with gay

Bunbunn

I was really shocked he got married so young, and my mom thought it was normal
Think?

Lmaooo
No, the thing that shocked me most was
My mom was like, yeah and I was hoping you have a kid before 30 ‎<This message was edited>
And I was like : 0

And then we got into a…heated…discussion about why I should have a kid to make me a “better person”

I can see why tho, because she had me at 28, and can still care for me in college
But when my sister goes to college, she will be nearly 60

I don’t think workign out will beat 10 years of age haha
Yeahh, we will both be infertile by 50, and prob mid 40s to be realistic ‎<This message was edited>
I was looking forward to seeing you bunbun ‎<This message was edited>

Im glad you didn’t point anything out about my vagina

Cuz I was insecure about it

😂😂😂😂😂😂

That’s funny

It’s biologically very normal
But aesthetically not I guess

Well maybe I shouldn’t have said anything

So you do have a preference?
Im sorry

Im being a little crazy right now

Its also a porn influence thing
I believe

That makes me feel better

I’ve stopped giving shit cuz it was making me feel sad
Hahahah
I don’t think I could make much money in that profession anyways

Cuz I’m such a pillow princess

But you should’ve have to be

I mean, im a hypocrite cuz out of my three kids, I have an obvious favorite

oh yes, I have felt very similar feelings

How dare you
‎sticker omitted

We should talk about this later as well, I wanna hear how you truely feel

It’s just like, any time we have free time, events are always planned around my sister
and when I point this out, my mom is always like but you don’t want to go anywhere
And when we do, it’s very hard to travel together because my sister and I have very different interests

So when I get upset, she makes me feel rediculous for fighting for attention with a 9 year old

Which has truth in it, but that’s not the point lol
For example, she wanted to go to pet cafe when we were on a trip, but I’m…germafobjc lol
I literally almost threw up when we enter the cafe
And so I just left and sat in a nearby cafe waiting for them to be done

And my mom was pretty upset
If my sister is there, nope. But I don’t really push them to either

Yeah but I made it clear I was unhappy, which in hindsight wasn’t very considerate
Yeah we will

Awwww

That’s so considerate of you. Now I’m really excited to try some

Always a plus
I miss you bunbun

I want to give you attention and get attention from you

Like the hikes and stuff?

Yeah, I haven’t thought of that

There’s tons of hiking places in California so
Omg yesss

Yeah probably, I’ll ask around

Would it work for you?

You lied to me about the any-time blow job deal already ‎<This message was edited>

You right you right

Loll
It’s ok, no pressure, I’m just freaky like that

But I do think we should have a lower bound, like once a week

sounds like a good plan ‎<This message was edited>

Hui has many uses, as of now, you can just remember it as the future tense.

It’s all good bunbun, don’t worry bout it
It’s is hui. Which makes sense because you are saying if this happens, then I will do this (in the future)

I love you bunbun, I’m happy we can talk about stuff like sex openly

I love crowd control characters

We will make sure that happens

Wtf
This is giving me ideas
I need to get you a pink bow

Honestly me too, but I’m curious to learn
E uma história simples: eu gostei muito do iogurte em arrilaga, tanto que quis o comprar.
Mas eu não sei o Brand

Então, hoje, eu perguntei alguma pessoa, quem trabalhou lá: desculpa☝️, você sabe o Brand desse iogurte?
What is formal about it 😂

Bunbun, do you understand what transformers are, in context of…language models

Can you explain the concept to me sometime

Yay, thank you. I’m just very lost whenever people talk about training models and other fancy words
Awww, you are a great teacher bunbun

Oh lol
I thought you were saying I just need to be attentive, and you will teach me the rest

I like the ambiance control, but I don’t like it being Alexa. I feel like my privacy is being violated ‎<This message was edited>

O k 🙄

hahaha

Lol, it sure is huh
Hahaha this one is very funny

I had to look up abençoado

Hot

and I’m not talking bout the weather

Bunbun, the staff here were talking about how hard is it to find someone (woman or man) who doesn’t perpetuate toxic masculinity

Hahahahha
I only caught the end of the lunch convo, but that’s the essence of what they were saying
And the entire time I’m just thinking, damn it’s unfortunate y’all haven’t met a right person for you

One of the juniors were talking bout how all the girls he dated actually encouraged unreasonable “masculine” behaviors
Things like not crying, not being vulnerable I suppose
In his experience, all the girls that he has dated were like that
And he was…kinda blaming women honestly
He says he doesn’t mean it that way, but it’s easy to shift the blame
I kinda wish I was there for the convo, but I was over at cesta looking at Brazilian maps

Yep, he has a…frat boy vibe

Well, somethings you only notice with time
What I mean with this whole story
Is that I really love you

How did you know 😳😳😳

omg you actually read my hidden thoughts

please 👉👈
You look so hot
Well you always do
‎This message was deleted.

And I’m just telling you how im feeling
Rather than…not talking to you about it

It’s ok bunbun. I happy that you enjoyed your time with your friends

Ah I see, thanks bunbun
This is the only one that makes sense to me

Loll I guessed so
I was watching a funny Chinese video and the puns and references were flying off the roof
And I finally understood how you feel trying to teach me Portuguese
If I were to explain one sentence, I would have to pull up 10 years of history
You know how easily detracted I am?
I was doing the press and it felt so hard

It does count, it’s just not quality time 😭. Like I’m not focused on you when I’m working out ‎<This message was edited>
Also…endorphins after workout? The only thing keeping me going is your pretty face and breakfast

It’s ok that we have different definitions of quality time

But it’s important to understand each other’s stand point

Because to me, it’s doesn’t count towards quality time

Im sorry for being unreasonaly picky with quality time, and I will work on being more compromising in the future

But I would also appreciate it, if you keep putting effort into spending time with me

Bunbun, how about we talk about it later

Because I’m getting upset and I have to work

It’s ok bunbun, I think it’s just hard to tell your tone through text

It didnt come across that way for me lol

I understand bunbun
Im fine now
But you are right, I will express how I feel in a nicer way
Call or nah
Bunbun should I wait for you?

Im getting dinner rn

It’s ok. Let’s just call tmr morning

Your sleep is important to me

But gosh why does that sound so nice

Me too!
Wanna chat?

‎Video call, ‎49 min

Bunbun Im insanely greatful that you stayed calm for me and didn’t hang up or get angry with me
I was thinking while biking, that we should have a designated time to talk about conflicts and complaints

It may feel slightly easier without the annoyance of surprise

Yeah we should, but it’s not easy to do so ‎<This message was edited>

It’s a nice feeling afterwards
I really wish I could hug you and comfort you though

that’s what I want when I’m sad
Haha you better
This scenario might be the only one where I beat icecream girl
I love you bunbun

You look so good 😭😭😭😭

Common bunbun
I really love you

thank you bunbun

Looking at you is like admiring a classical sculpture
Awww bunbun. I feel the same way.
It’s counterintuitive, but every time we get through an emotional challenge, I feel more safe and secure with you ‎<This message was edited>
But bunbun, I thought you weren’t working out hard
Why do you look like you started steroids
Are you being one of those people that say “oh no I didn’t study,” then ace the test 🤨 ‎<This message was edited>

I understand how you feel and the anxiety of feeling like everyone’s ahead ‎<This message was edited>

I talked with my mom about a similar thing because I was feeling big time jealousy
And she reminded me that life is an individual race, everyone’s got different pacing as long as we keep our eyes on the goal ‎<This message was edited>
Me too, but I also like the variety. Some friends push me to exert myself and others remind me it’s fine to not always push

Very windy

I couldnt really hear but I agree with your view on work life balance
Don’t worry too much, often times we have to make our own opportunities anyways

Hahaha bunbun you are talking with someone who has been transcribing speeches from the 1960s for 6 weeks

don’t doubt my skills

I’m glad
It’s nice that your home environment is not extremely grindy
I get so stressed when my mom only texts me about work

Ever since you inspired me to work out, my self-perception improved so much. Today I kept slamming into this bush as I turned a corner.  Instead of thinking I’m so clumsy, I think to myself that it must be because my shoulders are too big 😌

I love my cute bunbun so much too
Thank you for getting Ferdinand for me 😚

It’s sweet for you to consider this
I think my spending habits are a bit strange ‎<This message was edited>

I’ll give you a hug to make you feel better. And drink water bunbun

I want to rant about something

Aw it’s ok bunbun. Don’t force yourself to eat if you don’t want
But eating something is better than nothing. Do you have any snacks you want to eat?

Coincidêntally, my rant is also about food. I went to the dh, food was not great. I didn’t want to eat. But I forced myself to eat bunch of protein through eggs and milk
‎sticker omitted
But it was a sad meal and I wish I ate a cookie instead
It’s ok bunbun, i can understand your frustration

Bunbun, do you feel like you have people to talk to these few weeks?
I know you’ve been hanging with friends. Is that fulfilling for you?
I want bunbun to have a good mental health, don’t want you to feel isolated

I would like to understand more about how you are feeling
Morning bunbunnnn

I kinda had trouble falling asleep but woke up feeling good ‎<This message was edited>
Of course, no rush

I miss you bunbun. I wanna be with you 👉👈

Aww don’t tease me like that 🥺
That sounds so good right now

Omg
Naooo

Im sorry bunbunnn
I wish I can be there for you and take care of you

Do you feel like it’s getting worse?

Well you already coughed on me this morning so

Lmaoo
I hope ice cream girl doesn’t get covid
I know you weren’t using protection with her

Aw I’m sorry, that upsetting to hear

Yeah, I really understand how you feel
I will think of something to take some rocks off your pile

Ah I see

Im sorry you feel like he is being prioritized

I get it

Why do you feel like it’s not?

I understand. I think you know she loves you the same, but her actions don’t make you feel that way

It’s totally reasonable to feel annoyed about this
I would too
and I do sometimes with my own fam
such is life with a sibling ‎<This message was edited>

When you are feeling better, I wanna share something that’s been on my mind, related to sibling issues

I better be. I’m not great at sharing things Icare about

You can have orgy
But I get to pick the squad ‎<This message was edited>
Fair is fair

Yep, all girls

I don’t know yet. I have to stop by the elderly home

Not milfs
Gilfs
Or more like ggggilfs

Hahaha
It would be entertaining, for me :]

Aww thanks for caring about that
I’m not sure if I want to talk about it now. But maybe tmr When I have more time?

‎sticker omitted

Hahaha I’ve seen this one

This couple is super funny

Omg

good job bunbun

Feng yi
you wanna see it written?

How is it compound?

Chinese names are usually 3 words, or two words (including surname)

It’s like saying Bruno is a compound name because there are two sounds

韩丰翼
They aren’t full words by themselves

You’re lame

‎sticker omitted

Oh
My
‎sticker omitted

And you are my burro

You take Bruno, scramble the letters, chop the leg off of the n, and you get burro

Yea I’m a little crazy 😘

Looks so shiny now!

You didn’t need to lube it up?

Omg nao, those are sealed files. Not allowed for you
Haha I made every possible mistake you could make on the first date

What two things?

Can’t agree more

Awwww, I’m so touched
‎sticker omitted

I honestly didn’t even think I did that badly at the time

But looking back, big oof

Thank you bunbun. You have been an amazing partner for me as well. I cannot be happier to be with you

How did you learn?

hehe, two idiots became the best freshmen couple on campus

‎sticker omitted
You taught me a lot I do admit
I think I’m ready to put my skills to the test

Aww bunbun I feel the same

: 0

‎sticker omitted
I’ll only let you do that, if the new job is a big improvement

Hehe, I’ll make your compensation seem so attractive that no other position can compete
‎sticker omitted
That’s you, in my bag

Oh no bunbun, if you have any Vaseline, that could help the healing
I’m going to buy you baby powder
Don’t want bunbun to suffer

It’s a worthy sacrifice

Haha ok, I will watch out

‎image omitted

Hahhaha I was taking the picture for you
You are so cute
50 reais!!
that’s a whole brawl pass

I’m flattered

Every time I think I’ve heard the cutest voice message from bunbun, I get one that’s even cuter
Loll, pour it into a sealable bottle
I’ll drink it for you
Save it up for me bunbun
Is my bunbun awake

‎Video call, ‎21 min
ever since you opened my eyes to phonk, I cannot unhear the lyrics anymore https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7h6CUvIf1Z/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
I love you bunbun, hope you are having sweet dreams (of me) right now
bunbun is there Uniqlo in Goiânia? Or Brasil in general? I’m getting conflicting info

Explains why you speak English so well ☹️
bunbun is alive!!
How’s your head feeling

: 0
you are right tho. I really want to give you head

Fuck I dreamt of you again
You were next to my bed, and I wanted you to hug me, but your wouldn’t. And I was really confused

Why you so mean

Haha, no idea. You are so nice to me irl

Naoo
If it means I can get bunbun hugs, then keep pretending

It is!

Bunbun call me in 5 minutes please?

Kk
You better be free in 5 minutes :)

Ok lemme check this out

I just tried VR for the first time

Awwww I’m so glad you enjoyed, I always love talking with you bunbun
Don’t be nearsighted, I couldn’t see shit without my glasses
But it’s very cool, I can understand the hype of vr games now
it feels very freeing, like you can leave your body. Have you tried vr?
‎image omitted

Not ugly
Btw omg

The dude that the presenter brought with her
Is very socially awkward lol, I gotta tell you bout the interaction sometime
I’m really craving pickles for some reason
I recently tried a pickle flavored popcorn
Blair almost threw up, but I kinda liked it

Did you get interupted?
You’ve been feeling down?

Relatable. I still can’t spell things like receive, receipt,
Awww
“My baby…is you” Hahahha
You’ve been extra cute lately ‎<This message was edited>

I’m happy to keep practicing Chinese with you. But I might not be able to teach you step by step as I’m not an experienced Chinese teacher.  you can also look up some resources like video courses and textbooks
Sleep well bunbun, you are still sick baby

Haha, I’ll find a hot one for bunbun
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-baSBDy1pq/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Thank you for sharing your reels with me bunbun

Omg this didn’t connect with the reel ‎<This message was edited>
What the fuck is happening. What does cebolas have to do with anything

I want your ass
‎audio omitted
Onions and ants
Ants and onions
I think I’m focusing on the wrong part

Can you give me a clue?
I’ll give you 20% ass back

Ok
Can I google the song

Lolll
I guessed it was a sex joke
But I didn’t know the rola? part
I wish you went to buy onions, and I were a little ant
yum yum yum

‎sticker omitted
Please, another chance
‎sticker omitted

I’m excited to hear you opinions, but I’ll respond later

Haha
The hip to hip

I’m getting icecream with Blair

Fuck you 🥺

You are right. A healthy relationship really is about seeing and loving the good and not so good parts of your partner.
You make me feel really loved every time you are patient with my repeated mistakes on the way I communicate and every time you forgive me when I do something that upsets you.
when you tell me you like my stomach, and my face, and my occasional childishness
And I love you, even when bunbun won’t give me his ass
And waves it in front of my face
Bunbun, it amazes me how reflective you are. I admire that
‎image omitted
Also also It’s Chinese Valentine’s Day bunbun! There’s a mythological story behind it, but the characters became Altair and Vega. And today they get to see each other using deneb as a bridge aww ‎<This message was edited>
Please start practicing https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Z39q6oF0A/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

When you finish watching your games?
‎sticker omitted

Because Reddit

also poll vaulting is my fav Olympic sport to watch
‎Video call, ‎Ended

Yooo congrats to them
‎This message was deleted.

That’s understandable I think

I think beyond your home country, it becomes dependent on how much you like a country
And not how closely associated you are

Bunbun I won’t have time to talk after 3

Fuck I was gonna go to gym at 2:30

Yeah
Works for me

Me sad
‎sticker omitted

Ah bunbun, I’m sorry bout the call, I wanted to talk with you
Nothing is wrong, it’s just my brain doing silly brain things

Thank you bunbun for trying
Makes me feel better
Feeling cared for

You are gonna make me cry in the gym
Embarrassing lol

Nahh, I told you I was going to the gym 2:30
thought it would help

And I think it is

Many hot girls here

Haha

thank you bunbun. Even though you tell me that a lot. It still makes me happy every time you tell me again that you like me and just me

‎sticker omitted
Oop, I misread that
I thought you said that wasn’t true
Then bunbun would be the best liar I’ve seen

‎sticker omitted
Omg you are fucking with my brain
Hahahah
That’s scary
I love you bunbun
Thanks for being here for me

What is the ****

My brain just decided, hey you don’t need to be happy anymore

Haha, I believe so as well
I think I made some bad choices
that led to the really and feeling
like overeating at brunch, laying on bed after overeating
and (please don’t judge), masturbating when I wasn’t horny made me feel bad ‎<This message was edited>

And lastly, I just didn’t want to watch 106b lectures and consulting case studies

you sound so cute
My baby is working 😭
I have failed
I have to keep reminding myself this feeling will pass ‎<This message was edited>
bunbun I need you
Im getting withdrawlsss

Just wherever you are rn

Awwwwwwwww
Omg
Imma cry again

Love the view as well 🥰
They all look so good. I really wanna try the one wrapped with the leaf ‎<This message was edited>
I miss you too bunbun, I really want to be around you
I just went for a swim with Blair. It was really fun, but I’m so exhausted afterwards it’s crazy
I also forgot to bring a bra, so I had to go to arrilaga for dinner with my nipples showing omg
‎This message was deleted.
But Blair said it wasn’t noticeable and I was hungry af
Hahaha you calling me a bitch because of a hypothetical senário where I cuddle with someone else, is like me mad at you for dying in my dream
God you got me horny

Bunbunnn good morning

‎sticker omitted
I was hungry and it wasn’t noticible I think

Bunbun hug

Haha you being possessive of my titties  is hot ‎<This message was edited>

I tried to cover them with my hair to be honest
Haha omg

Haha, my titties are only for you to see bunbun

lol, she was basically saying I had small-ass boobs

They are

It was really really fun
We didn’t swim laps, just kinda fooled around
Like doing flips and seeing who can run the fastest in water
And then we saw this dad swimming with his kid on his back, and we tried that

But we couldn’t figure out how he was doing it, it was so funny

It’s not hot haha
talvez

It is bad I find it cute

but bunbun, there were so many girls in bikinis, no one was looking at me

Ok bunbun. It’s totally understanble. I’m sorry I’m making you feel bad

I know bunbun

I understand bunbun, but trust me, I only love you and I would never cheat on you

Ok
that’s good

I understand. It’s like that day you sent me your shoulders pic in the gym
and I got a little…mad that you looked so good, and everyone in the gym could see

Like you were posing for them 😭😭😭😭

lol I was wearing a one piece

It’s really not sexy lol

Coverage is pretty high on the back

‎sticker omitted

I’m glad you feel better bunbun

Lolll ok

I will put it on after I get out of bed

Yayyyyy
I’m so happy you weren’t suffering that much
during your sickness

Oo that looks good
Is that a one person serving or shared?
The meet and fries look so good rn

The swim really took my energy
Gotta do it more often

Yess

I finally understood your message

Awww that sounds cute af
Costaco loll
That’s exactly why I want to learn it

I would be very happy to learn it someday
I was just about to vent about something, but now I’m like what if I’m being the bad person

I’ll be back in the dorm in 15 minutes, then I’m free to chat
Basically

I just think that if you are gonna work in customer service, then be freaking customer oriented

Nah I went to wash an apple
Can we call
‎sticker omitted

Alright

What do you mean by biased towards Christianity?

Wow, that’s a lot of statues
Yes I remember

Should I brush up on my bible knowledge before I come over

I’m actually in contact with religion because of my research, since mlk was a preacher
He’s a great representative of what Christianity should strive towards
Thanks you. I’m glad we can agree on religion

And not be like Louis Litt ‎<This message was edited>

I feel you

That’s totally fine bunbun
Hope you are feeling ok

We _are_ a power couple
I can understand how you are feeling

We all need a safe place to regulate our emotions
And when that’s not available, it doesn’t feel good
‎sticker omitted

The sign Language one?

Happy to, I love watching shows with bunbun
And cuddling

:]

I love you bunbun

Damn

I’m excited for arcane as well

Sounds like something I’ll like

I’m excited to watch with you

‎sticker omitted

I do

Yayyyy
I was waiting 😈

I’m not sure

Looks like it is!

Hehe

Hahaha

I didn’t make that connection

:0
That’s deep

‎sticker omitted

What song is this

A little video message of you saying I love you 😘
What about for you? How can I best show my love for bunbun

or being like this reminds me of you

I see!

Hehe I’m happy you see me that way

aww bunbun 🥺

I’m touched 😭

I do believe you love me bunbun
But I have trouble with emotional permanence. It’s a little dumb, but you know how babies don’t have object permanence?
Well I’m still learning emotional permanence, and it’s definitely getting better

Lmaoooo
That was funny

Gosh I love your personality

You really are, you make me laugh when I don’t think could

And it makes everything more bareable
It’s just sometimes I’m upset about some small thing. Then you hit me with joke, and I laugh, and my appreciation for you puts my life into perspective
That I shouldn’t waste my emotions on smalls things

You are so strangely perfect for me

We did

Yeah…haha

I saw that haha
I like it
It’s actually quite beautiful

I like to think that we have the type of love that you see in fancy poetry

Off topic, but my glutes have such a pump

Wish you were here to feel

Very true

Me as well. And when I’m optimistic, I work hard to follow my vision
Fuck that would be amazing

This is what I imagine bunbun looks like on the ride to the airport
‎sticker omitted

Omg I miss read that the first time haha
That’s totally fine
You told me you weren’t feeling it

Oh yeah?
It’s squishy but firm

Like a good memory foam pillow

Hehe I like hearing that
I’ve been working on my diet and exercise combo
And I see progress

Hopefully you can see it as well in person

Hahaha

Thank you bunbun

I’m realizing that eating cookies and icecream isn’t bad
As long as I’m not binging and still eating nutritiously

It actually stops my binges

Man I’m still thinking bout the pistachio gelato I had the other day

I’m honestly not even restricting
I think
I just don’t feel as hungry anymore after the first few weeks

I’m so sorry to hear that bunbun

Yeah, I want to have a life with quality

And to be with bunbun as well

I’m happy for her

Resistente in the pool?
Is it for less stress on joints?

Aww, I think I would’ve liked him as well

He sounds like a very interesting person, with lots of stories

That’s a heavy feeling I feel like

Yeah?

Damn, I’m sorry

I can relate

Thats amazing

I wish I would remember to treat my grandpa better
Or even my parents
But I have so much less patience for them

It makes me sad that I would sometimes treat a stranger with more kindness than my family

I like that

I think it’s a good thing

Too many people get dragged down by their past
Me too bunbun, it would really make me sad if I treat you badly

What do you mean it’s not one sided anymore?

Hmm
I see

I think I feel that way with my mom

It does

We are moving into an adult role and it’s a interesting shift
and it’s our parents’ first time of being parents as well

Hahahah
That’s like me with Ferdinand

Lolll

That sounds like a horror movie
You should sleep soon yeah?

Awww
I really enjoy it
Seeing into bunbun’s big brain

Yeah I enjoyed this
Sure you are 😒
Hahah

Good night bunbun

Wo ye ai ni <3

Wan an 😘

awww
You remember all the important ones

wo ye xiang bunbun

Haha I can do that
I think I still get embarrassed

Bunbun, will you be on my side when I make a mistake?

I feel you were too impartial with me today

I know you were joking, but it didn’t feel like you were on my side when I needed you to be. It’s vulnerable for me to share my mistakes,
And I didn’t like feeling judged

Thank you bunbun

I’m sorry for taking it so seriously

aww thank you bunbun
Wow you are a sign language master

I love you bunbun

I’m not bunbun

I know you do
How was the meeting? Was it chill

Omg

Lmaooo
Bunbun you are too smart

hahaha

Omg sounds awesome
Im touched that you are considering this class

The cs classes sound so cool
The math is also cool, but I would suggest taking the psych class for some variety in your day

I gotta start thinking bout my classes as well

Wanna hear your feedback

Yayy

Silly bunbun
I’m looking at major requirement rn
What a headache

Symsys and MS&E

Management science and engineering

Yep

Engineering

I think you told me haha

Thank you bunbun

It’s just I’m trying to think if I should coterm, and how that should work
‎sticker omitted

Bunbun is very smart, I trust you will work out a balance

Imma go set up a meeting with my UAD

You can

With Gabriel
Idk if you UAD is available. But Gabriel is happy to meet with everyone
Akira went to him even tho he isn’t her uad

Send him a email to let him know your situation gkw@stanford.edu
He is super chill. Just say you wanna chat with a UAD and yours isnt avaibale
Just got an email from Gabriel about being in his cohort
‎image omitted

Does this convince you to send him an email

He was talking about “arcane rituals”
So naturally, he is gonna talk about arcane the tv show
His emails are always like this lol
I got a first draft of my autumn schedule
Looking pretty deadly rn

fall 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🏈🦅🦅

‎image omitted
Sorry for the bad picture
Its mainly used by British people
But I use both

Honestly, doesn’t look that bad

It’s not, it’s meticulously designed

Cs106b, ms120 are both requirements for symsys and MS&E

the Phil class is focused on analytical writing and the mind/beliefs? It is the prerequisite for lots of Phil courses

bio is just an intro to ecology course, which sounds fun

They fulfill requirements and sound interesting

Omg I forgot
Holy crap

I either do 14 units or 19 units lolll ‎<This message was edited>
I’ll do a plan of my whole year, see where I can fit it

It’s kinda fun

Btw, Gabriel plays DnD as well. Also his availability next week is gonna be limited, because he is reaching out to incoming frosh ‎<This message was edited>

Yessir

you want me to ask for you? ‎<This message was edited>

Oooo

OooOooo

Lmaooo
Hmm
I don’t think I would be very helpful lol

I would love to check out a class tho ‎<This message was edited>

I’m fine with doing it, I just don’t think my experience would be helpful and I don’t know what they want to hear

I have done info sessions for specific audiences

Like Chinese students going to American boarding school
O m g

You

I can’t believe you just said that 🫣
Haha thank you bunbun
I’m working on it

Now that’s some expectations
Are you sure the teacher actually wants it? Or just saying it

I hope it’s not a big deal

I guess not, I’m just wondering

Ok
‎image omitted

:0 why not

Awww

Lmaoo it’ll be hard
That’s fine bunbun, we don’t gotta call tonight

I feel you, sometimes I get tired at 8
Did you eat dinner already?

I think it’s not inherently racist to have a racial preference. It’s only bad if the preference is based on stereotypes (I think you can think of some), thinking a race is better than other, or anything that doesn’t recognize that there’s much more to a person than their race ‎<This message was edited>
I have thought about this question a lot
Because you know I find curly hair very attractive. That is borderline a racial preference because it’s not an Asian or Black feature (usually). Am I racist for liking it then? I don’t think so ‎<This message was edited>

What do you think?

Yes It’s a little strange

Lolll
That’s scary to think about

If you had cut your hair really short before ISO

me too honestly. But it’s more inconvenient

Hehe

Speaking of this, do you wanna see my swim suit?

What does this mean

Hmm
Is this an excuse for me to pay for our dates?
I will happily do it for bunbun

Omg

‎sticker omitted

Lolll

Damn
Where were they going

That does sound pretty awesome
But me don’t want

Think I’ll rather have 1-2 comfortable trips than 4-5 budget trips
You?

I agree

I’m sure we will make it so

Hehe, it’s a big ass task, you sure you can handle it? ‎<This message was edited>

: 0
We aren’t calling tonight right?

Sorry the connection is bad here
‎Video call, ‎Ended

I woke up late bunbun, might now be able to call you this morning

I gotta get ready :(

Oh no, sorry

I fucked up my hand

It’s just a little cut

Thank you

I was cutting cheese
But I grabbed the knife upside down

‎image omitted
It’s very little tho
Hell yeah

After I get out the bathroom
‎sticker omitted

Aww thanks for remembering. It is better
Honestly, eating good food helped

That’s awesome!

Yeah, I wish you could have an easy happy button like food ‎<This message was edited>

I know reels is one
Any others I should know about?

Looks yummy!

Haha sounds like me

Okk! ‎<This message was edited>
Understandable

Is that prosciutto in behind the coke
Yes 🫣

I’m sorry I’m so picky

A book is also a great choice

Shape, I tried one like that and it just didn’t work

I can make any color work

Bunbun you are the most beautiful man I have ever laid my eyes on
Don’t let badly designed clothing tell you otherwise

It’s a very common problem, not looking great in clothing that doesn’t quite fit
I have to tailor 70% of my clothing
No bunbun 🥺, you are amazing and you look like a greek statue ‎<This message was edited>
Omg I forgot Ferdinand in the frige
The ones in fancy art museum that everyone ogles ‎<This message was edited>
But you are in my private collection

Even if you did, you are still beautiful to me ‎<This message was edited>
And from what I’ve seen, it doesn’t look like you lost progress at all
Bunbun, your muscles look awesome
It’s also very difficult to work out alone
I’m ashamed to say I’ve also been skipping the gym a lot ‎<This message was edited>

_You_ are naturally hot bunbun
I don’t care what you think
I make the decisions here ‎<This message was edited>
And I am saying you are hot

No bunbun

I’m just been trying to control my emotions, but its not working that well

No
It’s just a phase

I don’t know bunbun
I’m just really sad. And people are trying to make plans with me but I just don’t want to
do anything

Thank you bunbun
I really wish I didn’t feel this way
It’s so pathetic

I just don’t wanna be here anymore

I miss you, I miss my family, I hate wasting time working on something I don’t enjoy

Thank you bunbun. I’m really grateful you care about my feelings

I feel unfair giving you this burden to help me

I’ll try bunbun
Thanks for making me feel better

Wanna call bunbun

Bun I’m going to head to dinner

My mom called you pretty
She was reminding me to be grateful for the things I have (I often forget this), and she said I’m lucky to have a good looking boyfriend
And apparently, my cousin’s girlfriend is not
Both my mom and my aunt does not approve of her lol, and I think for reasonable concerns
I’m looking through my pictures with you, and gosh, you are a beautiful man ‎<This message was edited>
Especially the video of you doing a handstand? 🫣🫣🫣
Hehe forgetting to enroll is you in a parallel universe where we never met
Ooo where can I get this device that turns off your phone? Asking for a friend
These are interesting, I gotta think about my answers
We are going to the Maldives https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-w06MUIJg2/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6Idx3LvuVE/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

I don’t have a pic, but it’s because she was impolite to my mom and my aunt, and my cousin spends a lot of money on her ‎<This message was edited>
Yep hao kan is the word for good looking (literally), and mei li is the world for pretty

Going to someone’s house and not bringing something?

I’m being annoying with gift giving

Don’t be annoyed with me plz

It’s just an irrational manifestation of my anxiety ‎<This message was edited>

Sure bunbun

Morning bunbun
How did that go?
https://smcovered.com/#enroll-here
Bunbun, can I get a selfie from you

Sorry bunbun for hanging up on you
I was biking and I ran out of data ‎<This message was edited>
So I can a dose of happiness
And feel your love for me

But what if…I am the cute girl 😚

Damn bunbun!
So cute. I love the little dance
I think I might be in love with you

Yes 🫣

I think we should touch shoulders

Hahaha

Omg you are never gonna let this go huh

You make me smile so much

Hahahahha
I can’t wait to hear your jokes in person again

Aww bunbun, every time my phone buzzes, I hope it’s a text from you
You have a permanent room in my brain

Haha me too bunbun. But I’m afraid it’ll get boring for you

Oh yeah?

Yep
I remember

Gosh, that week was something

I remember we got mad at each other in the basement of donner
And you left while still upset, and I chased after you

Cuz I was afraid you would end it

I remember I apologized, and you aknowlegded it
We really need to try the physical touch technique
The next time we have a emotional conflict

Yep

Aww
Well…

I haven’t seen any from her

Why am I so hungry
I wanna eat with bunbun
Why is she famous

sounds interesting

Bunbun the moon is soooo big tonight
Apparently it’s some blue moon event

Ahh that’s why I always see the same “side” of the moon

I was really hoping I would get some astronomy facts when I sent you the text about the moon ‎<This message was edited>
You did not disappoint

‎Video call, ‎10 min
You forgot to say something
‎sticker omitted
I will give you a chance to redeem yourself
I love you too

Of course, but do be aware that your grade can go down after a regrade

Well, your new grade is A+
‎sticker omitted

My only complaint is that the student should stop doing classes online

I still am surprised you gave me an A
I felt I could’ve been so much better in the past
Like big room for improvement
Gonna listen to your playlist now

Also I just ate an empanada, it was very good

Yeah, I understand that now

So funny 🙃

It’s interesting!
I will give you more detailed feedback later

I love these night herons. There are so many of them near my house in sh

And I hope I make you feel safer to share things with me everyday
Yeah you right…I almost went into a spiel about the maturity categories, but I stopped myself ‎<This message was edited>
Why do you say that? She is giving me the vibes of an admission officer lol. ‎<This message was edited>
A bit…but not rigorously

Have time to call?
Or should I head to dinner

Ok

I’m very hungry though
I kinda wanna go eat

It’s the cheapest but also has the lowest coverage
You should discuss your choice of plans with you mom ‎<This message was edited>
I chose this because I don’t anticipate using medical services often

It’s so cute I wouldn’t be able to eat it
I want them to make a Ferdinand version

So much so that I don’t wanna call you tonight

NAOOO😭😭
Bunbunnn
You’re suppose to offer your ass
And then I pretend to consider it

And then I forgive you

Fuck you

I want your ass

‎sticker omitted

Aww

I don’t open my legs, I just point my toes out
Which also opens my legs but
Oh yeah I do this for squats
For leg press, I just do whats comfortable
Cuz that machine kills me, right after me already dying from the squats
Also, I ran into Armando a few days ago
I was on the hip thrust machine
And he said “oh I can do a bit more weight than that. I feel better about myself now”
‎sticker omitted

Hahah
Well, quem faz desculpa não faz nada

Oh

you just made me cry
calling me wrong

Yes

It’s the type of crying that only your ass can aliviate
Very serious

😭
One day bunbun

Let a girl dream

NAOoo
Bunbun, do you think it’s strange to ask someone what cologne they are wearing

I asked my PI that today, and he thought I was judging his cologne choice

The prof.
loll
Well
He is wearing a $200 cologne, that in my opinion, doesn’t smell amazing ‎<This message was edited>

I wasn’t. I just happened to smell it. And my brain was like “Santal 33👀?”
lol, my meeting was with my college counselor company
I met their CEO of sorts?
Ready for bunbunnnn! ‎<This message was edited>

Take your time

Bunbun?

Bunbun I’m sorry I was complaining a lot during our call today. I wish I had communicated my feelings in a more reasonable way, instead of an emotional way

Hopefully we will both feel better tmr

I almost didn’t, but I started thinking, what if I actually did something wrong to bunbun, and I realized I did ‎<This message was edited>
I’m glad you feel this way about us
Sounds like someone needs to work on his finger skills

Yes you can 🫣

Well, it just seems like an incompatible lifestyle to me.
Morning bunbun

Im just afraid
I don’t know why, but I’m afraid when you tell me things feel off for a while or when you don’t seem to be happy talking to me
and it just makes me very anxious because I don’t know what to do
Maybe we have just been away from each other for too long
And call very frequently
That we aren’t as excited to see each other
But it’s scary

Thank you bunbun for reassuring me

I love you too Bruno

I really want to see you

Haha

I just wanted to make it clear I love you

Yessir bunbun

It was so much fun
I kinda taught Anu how to do freestyle and breaststroke

Yes
Happy  and hungry
very hungry

Hahaha so true

Omg
You remembered that
Hahhaha

Well this time

I remembered my bra

Lol yeah
Im excited to see this counselor again
He is a little crazy
Very fun to be around

Hell yeah

I was reading an article about the Tsimanes people, whose hearts “age slower”
And they have 70-80 year old people doing 3 day long hunts

I don’t wanna leave bunbun’s ass
But also, you can leave me
No matter how annoying I get

‎sticker omitted

It’s mine 😋

I am feeling better
But I would like reassurance

I think I just really miss you
And the pressure is getting a bit much
If I’m not working, I just feel sad
Is it similar to how you were feeling sometimes? Like when you feel like nothing you do makes the bad feeling go away

‎image omitted

Thank you bunbun, I really appreciate your efforts ‎<This message was edited>
Im doing well, spent an hour figuring out the 3d printer lol
‎video omitted
So freaking cool
Yeah I understand bunbun

…uh no🤫
You will never guess
What I’m using it for

Nope

Hopefully you get to see what it will be used for

‎sticker omitted
Because
Idk, it’s just a big fear of mine that you will be bored of me

Im glad you recognize that

That’s very reassuring to hear
Thank you bunbun
You communicate your feeling very well

And that makes me feel confident in your feelings

Que isso
Hahah that’s hilarious, lemme take my mechanical engineering class first, then we can talk
Aww
I like these songs

FUCK U
‎sticker omitted

Bunbun, have a good sleep and dream of me

Awww
Who said this

Ok it’s getting a little complex

Ohhh
It’s from that song
I never caught the rap part

Cute
It’s too close to my bed time 🥱
I feel drunk on sleepiness
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-m7NAIu6x_/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
I love you bunbun
Guess. I wanna guess yours too https://www.instagram.com/reel/C--poR5K0kd/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Good morningggg
Looks great
Because I suddenly had the urge to crochet

Bro how did you get it right???
Yes

I know you were into Pokémon, so I would guess 10.
But I feel like
That’s the trick option

…’me scared
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-5RVVzxhX3/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Fuck should I change it
I’m going with it

Haha
No
No European girls for you

I’ll give you a compromise
European men, or Chinese girl (singular). You can pick

Lmaooo

‎sticker omitted

Oh yeah?
If it ain’t sexual, don’t open this picture

‎image omitted
It doesn’t look that good, sorry bunbun

🙄

Thank you bunbun
I also don’t think of asses as a sexual thing

Bunbun
Give me a picture of your ass right now
‎sticker omitted

Estou esperando 👵🏼

Yeah I think I dropped a pic of your ass here
Doesn’t matter
Please bunbun

just a little bit
of that cake

Me in bed rn

Bunbunnnn
Hahahha

Ok we can try
‎This message was deleted.

It sounded interesting
I agree

Yeah I only have vague understandings
But now, I wanna learn about your ass

Bunbun
Fine, deals off

‎sticker omitted
Bunbun, no joke. I really would appreciate a picture

And it’s frustrating me

I have to get in the mood again

Ah you should’ve told me so

It’s ok
I think you took it kinda far

You were making promises/deals, but then breaking them ‎<This message was edited>
Or saying you are breaking them

And that was very frustrating for me

It’s not about the picture bunbun
It’s about you breaking promises

You did so here
Made up this condition ‎<This message was edited>
Felt like you were playing me for a fool
This is a ridiculous situation. I’m moving on. The emotionlessness of texts put us on different pages regarding the other’s feelings ‎<This message was edited>

But how would I know that

If you didn’t let me know

You should also consider my perspective

It is insignificant bunbun. Because I’m not annoyed because of the picture
But because from my perspective, you were just making me do things, and then not keeping your word

And I said it’s fine

I also feel that way
‎This message was deleted.
Let’s give this problem some time, and come back to it
I love you bunbun. I don’t wanna make you feel bad, and I want to find a solution for both of us

Ok, open your mind to me bunbun

Ok
I’ll eat a protein bar

I’m sorry bunbun, what are you anxious about

I planned to talk later, but if you feel like that will worsen your feeling of anxiety, we can try now

Is it too early to joke bout this https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-3KwtZIiZo/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Have a good sleep bunbun
I really liked when you reassured me after our fights.
I would appreciate you very much, if I could wake up to some of those messages

I cried reading about a character gettinf comforted by another lol
You know, I would like some now, to be honest

Thank you bunbun
But I don’t feel better after our fight today
That is my own problem to solve. You have done a lot for me already

I’m feeling very negatively. But I also don’t want to talk to you about it, because as you have said, every time we’ve called I’ve been upset at you. But this makes me feel worse, as I feel bad for feeling wronged
But I don’t know what to do. This is the worst I’ve ever felt this summer
I don’t really care that I’m feeling bad. But I don’t want you to dislike me, because I’m being this way

I’m just gonna try to let this go.

I know you are trying

I really hope what ever this is passes
it’s making me feel a bit detached

Like I just want to avoid
and not feel

No

Yeah you should. It’s pretty late
I’m sorry to be a downer for your night

That’s a nice way to think about it

Thank you bunbun, for your support

I liked the video bunbun.
Very grateful for you sticking by me

Good morning bunbun
Yeah
That sounds nice
Hmm, will try
Is this the type of gender reveal part you want https://www.instagram.com/reel/C90GZWdvkPE/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Yeah

How is bunbun

All in

Hahah cute

Damnn

Woah
I’ll check it out

Oh nice, which brawler

‎image omitted

Two, the other is ugly tho
No brawlers sadly, but I got more gems

Thanks for telling me bout it, it was fun to open all the star drops, manually, tap tap tap

What luck

Looks very fun

I love bunbun too
‎sticker omitted
I like your I love you messages a lot ‎<This message was edited>

Awww

Hahah

I like that. I always appreciate an I love you from bunbun

What’s up bunbun

Haha ok

Alright, Ill talk to ya soon

I guess I’m just the non binary one
‎sticker omitted

Hahahahah too late

That, no. Call me, yes.

Ok

I’m in the mood of not wanting to move 🥺
This is so bad
I really hope my mental health gets better soon. It is bothering my daily functionings
‎sticker omitted

Bunbun, I love you not because of you healthy habits, but because you are the most caring man I have met.

That’s my reassurance. But lemme know what specific kind of reassurance you want

Why do you think you are losing control?
I think I can relate to how you are feeling
I’m here for you

We can call or just text

Honestly me too
It’s hard, but it’s not a permanent feeling
My mom always told me that usually, we become unhappy if we don’t get something we want
But we forgot that we have so many good things already
Aww bunbun, i want to give you a very big hug

I agree

But we are a power couple, we will figure this out together
Even if we can only be on power saving mode rn
The feeling really is temporary
I thought the world was ending around me last night
Then I got out of bed, ate an apple, and boom, my emotions settled down

Shit, I heard bananas work too
But only if you ingest it with your ass
‎sticker omitted

When do you ever laugh at my jokes huh

‎sticker omitted
I always laugh enough for both of us at my jokes

Fuck off, if you are such a comedy master, then why are you depressed

Hehe I’m glad

Ok

Ok

Well, bunbun, you really are doing great. I’m really proud of you for holding on for so long. I know all the moving around and your friends being busy has been hard on you
And me, being a big baby

And yet, you make me and your friend so happy, and you are always fun to be around ‎<This message was edited>

Haha ok
Being a baby is not a bad thing
Sometimes we gotta let our adult side rest and recover ‎<This message was edited>

What happened to following this rule 🙄

My cute little hypocrite

When will I be able to do so
I have a lot to say

Haha fine
I’ll just hold me tongue for now

You can be my speaker of the house
We need one. You like cherry tomatoes, and I like cool lamps. Win win https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-22FJLg1sd/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Ok

Omg, im watching the video and I wanna rip my hair out

Ok bunbun. We can have a one on one lesson, if you know what I mean 😏

Why not
I just wanna learn how to play

Well you’ll just have to hear my story don’t you 😏

Omg, I would just leave
Not actually but

Hmm
The 10th is the next morning when I wake up.

Im cancelling my ticket rn

Hahaha, the rule applies with any Brazilian right?
Lets discuss this more during our call
And just so you know
I love you very much bunbun

And now I remembered cuz I was flipping through stories
He used to never post stories. But recently, he would post 3-4 everyday. And he told me, before, he would be sharing all these reels with his girl, but now he can’t. So he shares it with everyone instead ‎<This message was edited>
😭😭😭

It’s so sad

Like imagine, I see this cute bunny video

And I can’t share it with bunbun

Damn, I need a bunbun hug

Ok, I will be collecting

You think you ate something bad?

Poor bunbun, I wish I could take away your discomfort

Haha I know you were. But sometimes my insecurities take it seriously
I am also constantly amazed how hot my bunbun looks

Fuck, you are so good at comforting me, and making me feel better about myself

You know exactly what’s eating at me

This is really nice to hear. Sometimes I don’t give myself enough credit for the progress I’ve made

Hahahah
I’ll reserve a table for you

But thank you bunbun.

All thanks to bunbun being my motivation and my personal trainer
It’s really nice to feel how much you care about me
I hope I make you feel the same

Hmm true. Maybe they just need a hot ass trainer
Gosh that ass

You are right. Working out is a very long term plan

And I’m glad bunbun recognizes that in me 🫣
True, there are short term benefits

Haha, cute bunbun
Well our struggles are on the two different extremes lol

No talking shit about yourself
You are pretty. And nothign is gonna change that perception
And in my eyes, you aren’t just pretty. You are the prettiest man I have seen

Every time I see you, gosh, life is worth living

That’s racist

Thank you thank you, I’m very proud to receive approval from Mr comedy master ‎<This message was edited>

I love you bunbun. Thank you for being such a caring partner to me
Well great
Now you ruined my praise

How do you feel about yourself

Lollll
Asshole
I’m 15mins into the black hole video
It’s super interesting

But I wonder how they know, to an observer, the object would seem frozen in time
Like it’s just what their math suggests right

Haha

I’m kinda confused by the 2d cone diagram they had tho
To explain the space we could ever interact with?
Fucking hell its so cool

It’s so cool because I’m seeing things I learned in math 21 being applied to the explaination of how black holes exist

Haha just small things, like coordinate substituition (we used for vectors) and the idea of limit going to inifinity applied to time

Yeah,
That’s why it prob seems elementary to you

But to me, math 21 was my first math course where I got some understanding of math beyond algebra ‎<This message was edited>

I didn’t understand shit in ap calc

You think it should be earlier?

Oh

Haha I though you mean we should introduce such concepts earlier or something
Which I think would be interesting to try

What is a good “base”
That sounds very abstract

I see
That’s a big jump lol
I remember learning about functions

And all I understood was, oh you just draw a line on a chart

Education is definitely a complicated topic
lol bunbun too smart

You just get it

You’re like my mom

Damn, I’m envious
Oh well

I don’t think my sister inherited rhe intuition from my mom either so

Ok! Thanks bunbun

😭😭

Loll
Idk if that’s accurate

Well, this makes sense

But, statistics can be manipulated
If we play our cards right

And we got a good hand

Omg yayyy
Please tell you dad I said thank you

For taking the time to plan this trip
I’m walking out of lunch rn

That sounds amazing. I am planning to stop by the makerspace first ‎<This message was edited>

The woman in the picture is a only fans person, or does something related to porn. And she gave food to kids, very good.

Who stole from the rich to give to the poor

‎image omitted

Fine

‎image omitted
It’s just so messy

Hehehe
Oh I was thinking about donating it
Cuz you know, it’s just a normal jacket

I will take good care of it, so I don’t get in trouble
I wear it in the mornings sometimes when it’s too cold

Can’t I be both
It doesn’t smell like bunbun anymore

True

I don’t wanna be apart
I like this idea though
I’ll keep this idea in mind

Shhhhhh
Shhhh
Hear no evil

‎sticker omitted

Very emo song

Ooo

Ah, maybe something will happen during winter break

Of course
‎sticker omitted
I’m still thinking about that instagram comment about the eggs

Haha

Hmm

Me too

I thought it was no nut November ‎<This message was edited>

Lmaoooo

How did it go for you?

Loll

I don’t think even I could do it

Well bunbun, im also horny
Idk if I can actually do a week without coming

Do I get a cheat day 🥺👉👈
Omg

I already wasted most of the day
Shit, well she probably has work and stuff

Fuck that’s kinda hot
Great now I’m even more horny thinking about you fucking me
Oh god

Wo ye hen ai ni bunbunn

haha wo ye xiang
It’s so

It feels so heartfelt when you say you want to zuo ai
To me at least. It different than saying I wanna fuck

aww xie xie
Wo xiang qin (kiss) ni

Cute

Ok
Bro
When the 5 other dudes showed up
My jaw dropped

What did you think about romance before?

Bruh they missed out big time

But I’m glad they did, otherwise I wouldn’t have had the chance to love bunbun

Probably, highschool is a very turbulent time in terms of developing our…personness

current gfS

Hmm

I can relate. That was me in highscool

Im glad you realized what you value bunbun

I think you have a very healthy and sustainable view on relationships

: 0
Not this again
I give you a complement, and you prove me the opposite lolll

I love you so much bunbun
It’s actually overflowing in me

If you are ready to grow from pain I think

,it takes a lot of reflection, and that’s not easy to do

: 0 im just so troublesome

Yeah?

That’s awesome

Aww bunbunn

Thank you for considering my perspective

I learned a lot from bunbun as well

Mostly about communication
You really are
In the most original sense

Lolll

The strength of the adj awesome has been diluted

So I mean you are awesome with the original magnitude

Hahaha
HAHAHA

lmaooo
That’s actually so funny

Still me

‎sticker omitted

I glad I could do that for bunbun

Yayyyyyy

I would be very into that

Hell yeah
I ain’t losing to bunbun on language learning

But I’m scared

Cuz bunbun is strangely good at Chinese

I think Spanish is the most practical one, but maybe not the most fun

It will

Im just glad you are considering it so seriously
And taking a freaking Chinese class
Makes me very happy

Haha
I think you have a good brain setup for language learning

haha

dan shi
Hahahahahahha

Bunbun, your sentence doesn’t make sense

Da means big

diao is dick, jiao is feet

It’s actually the same tone, different sound

I was trying to joke it doesn’t make sense to say your dick is big

Not gonna admit your joke execution is better than mine

‎sticker omitted

Im happy with that

You better think I’m funny

our humor matches well

I love your jokes. They really make my days better
Wanna hug bunbun

😭😭 I wish

Bunbun

It’s similar to Japan

Ok it’s not similar to Japan in that sense
I just call my friends by their full name
Which I think is what most people do

Cuz Chinese names are short af

Yep, han fengyi
Hey Bruno de moraes Dumont

Yes

Yessir

Food was soo good 😭😭😭
I haven’t had Chinese food for so long

I felt so bad because I didn’t want it, but then she also offered me a ginger sparkling water

‎sticker omitted
Giving bunbun a hug rn
Mentally

Loll
I can’t believe I found someone who loves winning more than me ‎<This message was edited>

I hide it better
It’s a strategy

To get you to lower your guard
So I can win more muahahha

‎sticker omitted
But I do agree I got less competitive over the years
Because I realized winning doesn’t matter as much as getting what you want out of the experience
And sometimes what’s valuable to you isn’t “winnin”

‎sticker omitted
Oh god, the nausea is back
Only a true bunbun’s kiss can save me

Eu tô cured

Eu adoro quando ce compliment meu português ‎<This message was edited>

Aww that’s cute

Fuck

I’m a failure

I should just stop speaking

I bring shame to the language learning community ‎<This message was edited>

I’m liking the bunny girl anime
Is Mai tied to this dude somehow? Like she only exists when he observes her?
Nah, no she’s not
That did happen in a web novel I read, where this character’s world would only generate when this other person is around
And he would get snow blindness, cuz the ungenerated world was just pure white
Omg im gonna cry, he forgot her 😭😭
Omg
Thank you very much bunbun
I’m sure I will like it a lot

Yess
Got some water from Starbucks
I’m all set
Waiting for them to release the gate number so I can go find it
What are you up to?
I’m kinda tired lol
I was planning to explore the airport, but I can’t get up from this chair

Hahahahahahha
I just imagined someone calling their kid 婴儿

Come here infantil
hahah I don’t wanna tell you the correct pinyin

xiǎo bǎo bao
That’s a cute way to say little baby

You are calling me brother

I think you gotta be sharp on the tones to get this one right
Cuz it’s a very particular word

Ok bunbun, see you laterrr

Ah
Do you wanna sound like a Chinese professor from the 18th century?
Or do you wanna speak Chinese from the streets

haha jokes aside

those pronunciations in your book are correct
But that is not what you will hear outside of class
Bro this classroom is cursed

Every time I’m here I start getting nauseous
not extremely

just uncomfortable

That can be easily modified
Idk
We will solve that when we need to

Are you thinking of making cards?

They are not doing your hw for you, you are just learning with their help
Hug hug bunbun
It’s doesn’t mean you are stupid

Yayyyyy

I’m happy that you figured out the problem
Ain’t nothing wrong about expressing how we feel

If I did that, I wouldn’t keep asking you
and I didn’t know cuz you didn’t tell me you weren’t free for dinner
Next time just answer my questions please bunbun

It’s ok. I’m sorry for pushing my anger on you ‎<This message was edited>

Ernesto is a great contact
He is in a leave of absence

Bunbun so smart

Thank you very much bunbun for preparing something for me

Awww, I do want to help you

What a dilemma
Haha yes you need leadership from the bunbun leader

Damn you are really productive

I really hope the internships work out for you bunbun

I will still like it if it doesn’t bunbun

lol, you always copy me
I’ll take it as a compliment 😚

Why not
Loll

That’s apparently what Ernesto is doing

Stanford loves that shit, you can take so many years of absence
That’s true bunbun
It might not be worth it for you

Ask if a summer is ok first

Like summer internship

Ah I see
Learn more about the startup from him
See if you feel like it’s a promising idea
Idk, if it pays well, looks like it has potential, and wants you, I would give it consideration
And talk to a ton of people for suggestions (academic advisor, people who took gap years, etc)
But take my thoughts with a grain of salt, I get impulsive sometimes

How do you feel about that?

No I don’t want you to go

Especially for a whole year
I would consider it, if I had this opportunity

‎sticker omitted
I do really love you bunbun

Have you asked Ernesto about the startup?
I’m really curious what they are doing
Idk if he can tell you much

What does that mean

Interesting interesting. I wonder why Ernesto decided this was the one
Cuz I heard he is great at the recruiting game

yeah, I feel you. But you gotta think, is this opportunity once in a lifetime?

That’s understandable bunbun
I need better glasses
I saw someone here in McMurtry that I thought was you lolll

He is dressed EXACTLY like you

‎image omitted

I forgot what this means
Tough?

Hi
It’s Akira
Fiona!
Woah, I just found out that my 2 lamps can provide light for the entire room
‎[9/23/23, 21:16:34] Akira Tran: ‎image omitted
‎[9/23/23, 21:16:45] Akira Tran: ‎image omitted
Hahahaha it looks like the lamps are dancing with each other
Hey, I have language-related questions
Firstly, is language modified through time by social relations and power mechanisms?
I believe it is
And secondly, if it is, do you think language arts can be dominated by this?
Define Dominated
So language has Semantics which is rules that don’t change
And pragmatics, which is how language is actually used by humans in society
Pragmatically, language is definitely affected by popular culture
Semantically, I’m not sure. That’s a different topic
I saw some author saying: other arts uses technologies, so they’re impacted by social and power stuff. In contrast, poetry is kind affected, but not “dominated” (so maybe not too much affected, I think?).
Hmm lemme get back to you, I’m going to package centre rn
Do they’re saying poetry is affected, but the core doesn’t change?
Ok
I’m honestly not sure, I might have to read the whole thing to undestaand the author’s argument
Oh wait.. I think I’m making this thing complicated. The author is saying poetry use technologies sometimes, but that doesn’t change it 😅
If pragmatics change, do the meanings of what we say change?
Or at least the manner, if I’m using the right word
Yes. Pragmatics is the study of how language is actually used by people in society. So if the meaning of a word changes, then we would study why it changed
Thanks, that’s really helpful
Which side r u sitting?
I just got to Wilbur
Hey
Where r u sitting
I’m still getting food
Hey, my RA just told me that we have until the end of this week to switch between frosh 101 sections. Can you join this one, please?

Hey Akira, can you meet me outside donner before frosh 101 today? ‎<This message was edited>
I have no idea where to go 😂
Ok
In case I can’t be there ( since I got a meeting right before frosh 101), just go to the burbank area of the dining hall and get in. The moment you’re in, you’ll see the place
But I’ll let you know if I can’t go to Donner
I’m coming
Where r u standing?
I’m in donner rn
Donner lounge? Or…?
Where are you?
Where in donner? 🥲
I’m going through the dinging hall
Between donner lounge and dinning hall
Hey
Remember the lime tree you told me near the club fair?
It was actually lemon
I just checked today
Have you opened it?
And they ripe in Nov
Oh really! I haven’t opened it yet. I will try today
I’ll also open mine today
Hey
Do you have to go to that jenny odell thing?
I do!
Wanna get dinner after this?
Ahh I already ate :((
:(
Japanese hw took away my dinner time…
Help
I can’t come in
‎[10/17/23, 16:30:06] Fiona Han: ‎image omitted
Hey I’m at the door again
Could you let me in please
I just asked people to let you in, but I’m also coming down
Thanks!!
How did you sleep last night?
Great
You?
I slept great! No interruptions
That’s so nice
I’m just back from the Japanese sweet shop
Now my room is loaded with them
Let’s have matcha sometime
‎[10/25/23, 13:11:22] Fiona Han: ‎sticker omitted
Yesss I would love to
And I’ll learn from your methodology of making tea
So I can upgrade from my super cup
…
You’re stabbing both your roommate and I at the same time, Fiona
Hey, I'm encountering a situation related to sweets where I don't know what to do, can you give me some advice, please?
Mostly, the part where I don't know what to do is whether I should give sweets to sb
I think who ever you give it to would love to receive your gift!
If they don’t, they are an asshole
Erm… here the problem
Here’s*
I have 2 RAs on a floor that’s not mine
One is a friend
One is my crush
The one who’s my friend, I’m going to give her sth
But
Ohh…definitely gift your crush the sweets
And tape a short sweet note on there
There’s a “but”
There’s no reason to
So it’s weird
I was going to say that
Since that one is very competitive about who’s the best RA
Especially in competition with my friend
And I’m giving my fr sweet
I’m giving my crush sweet too
Is that valid?
Or is it weird in a worse way?
Wait… so I shouldn’t knock?
Btw, I’m just overly scared since that’s a senior
Aww don’t be worried
I mean tape a note onto the box of sweets
Yeah totally. I’m sure it would make both your friend and your crush very happy
🤔
So can I knock?
Yeah yeah
How how much sweet is enough?
So*
I would say give a small box
And be like “if you ever want to try other flavors just knock on my door
How much in a small box/bag is enough?
You can decide that
I think they’d never knock but yeah…
Haha it’s alright
No I can’t :(
The point is planting that idea into their head
Well take a pic for me
I can help decide if you want
Ooh!! Human manipulation
Yes, help
No no 😂 I prefer the word “suggestion”
Do I need to give my friend the equal amount?
Nope
What if they talk to each other?
If they talk about the sweets (which is not that likely), is it more unlikely they will talk about the size
Don’t worry bout that
But if that worries you, give them the same gift
🤔
If sb needs tea to eat a sweet snack (which I saw her doing last time), does that mean that person like stuff that are not too sweet?
Haha I think they’ll appreciate the thoughtful act of you giving a gift to them, over what you actually give them
I mean, that’s how I would feel idk about other people
Try not to overthink, it’ll just make you anxious
‎[10/25/23, 15:27:27] Akira Tran: ‎image omitted
Is this the right amount?
‎[10/25/23, 15:27:37] Akira Tran: ‎image omitted
And is it ok if I put it in here?
And tie it like this?
‎[10/25/23, 15:27:55] Akira Tran: ‎image omitted
The little baggie is perfect
The snacks?
Do you think it’s too much?
Since I’ve only known her for a while
She’s done nothing much for me or anything
AND
She got a partner already
Maybe putting one of each sweet into the baggie would be nice
OH
And yeah
She probably can read my minf
Mind
If I’m not careful
That’d be 5 times that amount up there
‎[10/25/23, 15:33:19] Fiona Han: ‎image omitted
I mean these
Yeah, is that too much or the right amount?
‎[10/25/23, 15:55:00] Akira Tran: ‎image omitted
Do you mean I should have less?
I think giving just those 4 is great
But you can give more as well
5
4 is death…
Hey sorry for not inviting you, I just wanted to talk bout some personal stuff with pauline
‎[10/25/23, 19:01:22] Fiona Han: ‎sticker omitted

And this time, I’ll be on time
Haha no pressure
Hope it went well!
The test part wasn’t but the thing after that was: I finished at 9 so it’s either I did sth wrong or it was actually easy. Then I went back and my crush hugged me bc I was anxious 👌
Thanks for the luck
And the walk
I’d say in any case, it’s still so much better than my first midterm
How is your hw?
That’s great!!
Haha I’m still procrastinating my hw
That’s….

I would love to go to sf with you again!!

And quick question: have you ever done a rhetorical analysis before?
I have an ra draft due tn but I’m a bit stuck so I’d really appreciate if you can give me some peer review
Yes I have, I would love to read your paper
Let’s decide next week when it’s closer to the opening date
It’s a very rough draft since the first draft is due tn
I hope you don’t mind
Is it ok if I send it thru email?
Your email is hanf@stanford.edu right?

I’m reviewing an article abt KotS
OMG YOU NEED TO READ ITTTTT
It’s too good to be real
Ok, I feel like it may be more productive for you to explain your thoughts to me. maybe we should talk bout this after dinner or something?
I have to go to SF with an ITALIC prof today :(
Oh cool! That sounds fun
The draft is rough in the sense that I haven’t added all evidence in yet
Noooo… it means we can’t talk abt it in dinner
I only have the rough ideas laid out
Yeah I’m a bit confused by the structure
You can ignore the last 2-3 paragraphs since I wrote that at 12am
Yeah… I don’t know how to structure an RA
So I just wrote whatever
To get rough ideas laid out
Now I’m having problems organizing my thoughts
What class is this for?
ITALIC
Actually, ITALIC PWR
Prof was like: “have a rough draft guys”
🤡
So I’m officially stuck
So in ESF, they had us start with a central claim (thesis) and three supporting claims
Ok, I got to go now
Hey, wanna get dinner?

Did you focus in class tho…
Hey Fiona, you wanna get dinner tgt?

‎Voice call, ‎19 sec
Hey Fiona, wanna start walking there now?
Hey Fiona, do you have a carry-on suitcase that I can borrow, pls? I just realized that I can only bring carry-on for the NY trip. But the carry on I brought here is specifically for my Wacom tablet only, and it’s too late to buy a new one already :(
If not, totally understand
‎[3/21/24, 10:52:50] Fiona Han: ‎image omitted
🥹
Can I come get it tmr morning pls?
Yes of course!
Can I come at around 11 pls? And wanna grab lunch tgt?
Yess let’s do that. Let’s meet in stern ?
Yeah, that sounds good
Wanna get lunch first? Then I can grab the suit case for you
Ok
‎[3/27/24, 18:27:20] Akira Tran: ‎image omitted
Hey Fiona, wanna go here with me?
It’s free, ticket open 1h before it starts
For stanford students
What is taiko?
Looks interesting!
Yeah let’s go check it out!
How is your spring break going?
Nyc is hectic
But fun
We’re visiting so many studios
And I’m getting mote advices from alumns
Woah sounds cool
Abt your spring break?
That’s awesome!
I’m not doing much, just reading and crocheting
Check out this hat I made
Woah that’s a lot
‎[3/27/24, 18:31:25] Fiona Han: ‎image omitted
👀👀👀👀
I’m gonna steal that
I made it with a machine, so it was fast, like 2 hours
Bruhhh
Haha if you want one I can make you one
You gotta show me how to do that
Today I spent 3 hrs looking for one to buy
In nyc..
Yeah!! It’s super easy, we can go to the maker space
And couldn’t find one that could fit my big skill 💀
That’s insane
relatable
You must be talented
I don’t believe anyone can make that in 2 hrs
The maker space doesn’t have a lot of yarn though, so if you care about quality/material and color, best to bring your own yarn ‎<This message was edited>
Haha you flatter me 😚
One sec, searchi ng it up
No fiona, i literally spend more time looking for it than you spent making it
That’s no flattering
What yarn did u used?
I’m search online rn
‎[3/27/24, 18:36:12] Fiona Han: ‎image omitted
How did i know what size to choose and what brand to buy?
Because of the machine, I would recommend getting size 4 yarn
brand doesn’t really matter? I usually just go by how they feel in my hand
A limitation of size 4 is that you won’t get a very fine texture on your hat, the stitching will look obvious as you can see in the picture
That looks good to me
Quick question: how much yarn does it take tk make a hat?
For me, it practically took one roll, so about 180m
Ok, I’m gonna get some yarn tmr
After my animation studio visit 😰
ooo tell me how it goes!
I will
Wait…
Tell me more abt the makespace
Makerspace*
What else do u do there?
In the textile maker space, you can do stuff like needle felting, embroidery (with or without machine), making clothing/sewing, basically anything you can think of!
Hmmm
The first few weeks for spring will give us some free time
Wanna make sth tgt?
Yeah sounds good!
Hey fiona
Is this a good type of yarn?
‎[3/28/24, 15:49:17] Akira Tran: ‎image omitted
Yeah it looks good
Ok I’m buying them
Hand wash only seems a little annoying, but if you don’t mind then
Yeah, they’re sooooo soft
Also 150m may be a little short? The size of my hat took around 180 meters of yarn ‎<This message was edited>
but it will definitely still work
Yeah I got two each
Each color
So I got 4 of that
Hey Akira, when you are coming back to campus?
Hey, I just got back at 1am yesterday
(Or this morning)
Wanna grab dinner tn?
I want to! but I planned to eat with Bruno when he comes back
Damnn what a flight time
Lemme check if he is coming back tonight
:(((((((((
Yeah, it got delayed
How was your spring break?
It was very relaxing
I wanna hear more about your break over dinner!
Yeah, lmk if you can have dinner with me

Ty
I met so many interesting people
There was this woman whose house we had lunch at
And looked at art around her house
And she just randomly pointed on the wall: “this is Picasso’s”
“This is Matisse”
👀
Wait..like originals?
Yeah…
: 0
And random cupboards in the hallway are Chinese’s antiques
Bruh, how does she not get robbed
She has butlers walking around all the time..
And she lives in the upper east
Her house is 22mil already
Wow
I think robbers just need to break one of her bricks of and have mission completed
😛
Off*
Lmaooo
What does she do for a living?
I think nothing..
???
How do I also do this nothing
And get a matisse
Cuz she also pointed on another the wall and say this is my mother in law painted by Andy Warhol
what the f
She’s probably born into it brush
Bruh*
I mean… she funded our whole trip too
0 :
O…k
I also want to do this nothing
Hey Fiona, wanna grab dinner at 5?
Yesss

Rising bird fellow

Just different hours
How did you write your cover letter?
Hmm lemme check the career center page

They are making it difficult
Lolll, they are asking for resume and cover letter
My resume has nothing to do with art 😭
I’ll try regardless
I think they might go easy, don’t worry
Alright alright, I’ll email them tmr morning
thank you for telling me <3
No worries
Of course I’ll share part of my stuffy mail box with you 💀
Hey Fiona, wanna do crochet or sth on Sunday,
?*
Or watch something tgt this quarter
Interestingly, my homework or required coursework this quarter contains a lot of films that might be fun to watch tgt
A professor even shared with me a whole folder of scripts
I just realized that the maker space is closed on the weekends
Yeah that sounds nice! What are you thinking of watching
Noooooo
I’ll send you a list of things
Today
Hey Akira, did you do an interview for the front desk position? Inge is asking to chat with me tmr ‎<This message was edited>
Could you tell me more about what you do in this position? I wanna be a bit more prepared
Yes, do you wanna grab dinner rn and chat?
Everything I do is listed on the email
Inge might ask you will you be comfortable to come open doors for people instead of giving them keys
The answer should be yes
Sounds good!
Losing keys is a big issue on an open campus
Ok, running back from mc murtry
No rush
I’m here
Ok I’m coming down
Hey where are you sitting?
Hey, wanna hang out in mcmurtry later?
I’m actually there right now

Sounds like a good plan
Is any one helping you with it?
Nope, but if I can’t figure it out, I’ll ask my friends in donner

How’s your research going?
Yoo that’s sounds so nice
What are you doing these days? Relaxing? ‎<This message was edited>
It’s going ok! I’m not doing ground breaking work, but I am learning interesting skills
Nah I’m working at night bc I’m in Indochina time, finishing some work I need to submit this week, and realizing that my family is not respecting what I do, but it’s fine tbh
What skills?
Still sounds exciting, tho
Are you having fun?
Aww no, I’m sorry that’s happening
It’s ok, the work is a little monotonous. But I’m picking up skills like basic HTML and learning about fancy AI models
What? That’s so cool!
How’s that basic..
I don’t even know what an HTML is
Have you found an AI model that could do your math homework? 🌚
Lol I wish
Hey fiona, you’ve taken 106b right? Did it feel like you needed 106a to take it?
And is there a place online that I could watch 106a lectures in the past year or prepare myself for 106b before the autumn quarter, pls?
I made a mistake not taking it earlier :(((
Hey Akira, if you have no coding experience, 106b is gonna be a big jump
It’s a jump even for people who have taken 106a
All materials are on this website, but it’s updated for every new quarter of 106a https://cs106a.stanford.edu/lecture/14
Yeah I think I’m in big trouble..
But it’s not too late to take it in winter
Why do you want to take the course?
I have 0 confidence in CS, and just realized if I only take 106a next fall, my parents are going to kill me
Bc that’s too late+slow
It’s totally fine. You aren’t a cs major right?
My second major needs to be CS
And that’s a bit late now i think
Chat with your academic advisor or Gabriel
They are just much knowledgeable about this
Is it possible to speed run the whole thing in a month?
But I don’t think it’s too late at all
Yeah all the lectures are not here
You can def do that with 106a.
They’re on canvas for this quarter
So I found an equivalent on youtube
Cs50 of harvard
Yeah that could work
I’m just not 100% sure if it covers everything of 106a
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381WAHyx1pq-sBfykqMBI7V4&si=IHoTHZUiZ2SK042e
I think as long as you can understand the logic behind coding, you are good to go
Can you help me check it pls?
That sounds tough :(
So 106a is 95% about python coding ‎<This message was edited>
You just need a basic understanding. Knowing how dictionaries, nested dictionaries, and nested lists work was basically our finals
‎[8/3/24, 20:52:13] Fiona Han: ‎image omitted
First time????
You were missing out
How is it?
It’s good! I liked the pandan jelly and the red crunchy things
Good to hear
Does it taste familiar? Like something from china? I remember my mom saying that chè is an adaptation of something we stole from your people
哈哈I’m not sure, it reminds me of 烧仙草（shāo xiān cǎo）
Holy.. i searched it up
We definitively stole this
haha who knows, maybe we stole it from you
Akiraaa! How are you?
Did you decide on taking 106b this quarter?

Hey fiona, for the first part of the perfect numbers, do we have to do it 4 times and stop at the largest number that giev the processing time of 60s or so, or start with the number that take 60s to process, and double it from there?
It’s taking a million years to complete this 😭😭😭
I think you want 60s to be the max time it takes to process
So find the 60s number and divide it by 2 to get the 4 numbers ‎<This message was edited>
Yeah try smaller numbers
Got it, thank you
Akira! Do you want a persimmon delivery
Dinner?
Wait i missed this
Yes pls!!!!!

Hey Blair, the on-call is asking for us to bring bowls, so bring 1 or 2 (2 for strawberries?) bowls if you are coming!
On my way! now
but my phone died so can u just go downstairs to get me in 5 mins 😭😭
Yess
Blairrr, my norcliffe friend is not gonna be in the dorms this weekend :(
We either can find someone else to let us in, or move the baking to next weekend
Oh no!
‎[8/2/24, 17:56:00] Blair Schooling: ‎sticker omitted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvI3xm-b0ao
We could make this!
PLS
That looks so good
Yess, they do ask for two egg yokes in addition to two eggs. But we can just half everything
Hey when are you up for baking this weekend?
i'm good whenever!
i just ate brunch so i'm good all day if you want, or i could do tmr
Me too! I was thinking of grabbing some milk while I’m here
oh perfect!
we could also get more eggs right
Yeah but only during dinner
ohhh
ok
do we wanna just do it without them
Without eggs?
without the extra 2 eggs
I think we can just half the recipe
Oh that could work as well?
i mean idk
its worth a try if we're just missing 2 egg yolks
Do you have any baking containers 😂
I just realized we need like a cup mold of some sort
uhh
glasses from the dining hall should work? i can go grab some if you can too
Yeah I can grab one
how many do we need?
I think two is good
okok i'll get one too
do we have a pan of sorts to make the caramel?
Are you still in the dh?
no im back in my room but its nbd
Hmmm I’ll check EVGR
Do you wanna meet in toyon at 12?

I don’t see a pan 😢
I just borrowed one from my roommate!
Weee good
Were*
Alright I’m coming over then
‎Video call, ‎No answer
Can you also grab some partchment paper?
do you like matcha?
toyon has matcha and face masks at 3 if you wanna come :)))
Ahh sorry I just woke from nap
I might have to skip this time, even tho the matcha is tantalizing
Would you be interested in finding our flan tmr and perhaps playing squash
Sounds like a good plan!
Hey when do you wanna meet for squash today?
Are you not sore at all from Saturday?
I don’t mind! I get off work at 6 so anytime after is good
In a satisfying way
Also! Toyon had succulents at 6 if you wanna grab some
Loll, idk how but my glutes are sore
Same omg
Im not great at keeping them alive, but we can check it out
shdushdusbxs
Im also free at 6
I tjink I’ll probably eat dinner after squash, so do you wanna head over when we’re both off work
after free plants *
Sounds good, so meeting at toyon at 6-6:15?
Yeah! Perfect
Only if you’re ok with delaying your dinner a bit? Don’t wanna force you to starve
Oh I was planning on eating the food in my room anyways so ‎<This message was edited>

Sorry about that
Thats ok! Just lemme know when you get here and I’ll let you in
Parking
Blaaair, are you coming to the sweet greens thing tonight? ‎<This message was edited>

I might take a peep at the evgr one at 7, and if it’s individual bowls I’ll give you a text
oo ok!
that sounds gg
If not, I’ll head over toyon
Individual
They are being very difficult tho
Asking for two people to come
mmm
Zareens got pushed back to 7:45 in toyon
Should I come to evgr or do you think it’s best not to
You wanna come over?
Yes
Ooo ok ok
They aren’t gonna give me one without two people lol
Oh I see what you’re saying
On my bike now :))
Honestly they might run out
I’ll see u outside the main lobby entrance?

Also, I’m on the waitlist for the Saturday thing
But I will show up to see if I can get a ticket

how committed are we to showing up early and trying to get on
do you really want to go?
If you are excited for it, we can show go 30 min early
honestly? i'm not committed at all
Then we can swing by like 15 minutes before? If there’s a long line, we can dip
i've been on an on-call boat trip before and it was fun but like my heart is not set on going with summer session students tmr
agreed!
and go play squash or smt
or swim
omg yeah that sounds like a good alternative!
Lemme know when you get here :))
Here
Blair! Can you grab my bag as well please?
My water is in there
no
:]
Blair, should we just go with our squash/swim plan instead of SF? Or do you think it’s worth it to try for tickets
Im happy to give up honestly
do you wanna okay squash and then once we’re warm, go for a swim?
I’ll have to get dinner sometime between squash and swim then ‎<This message was edited>
I’m gonna run out of energy loll
