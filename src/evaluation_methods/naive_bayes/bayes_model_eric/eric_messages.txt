"> \"For years, Wayzata High School has been able to successfully partner with Wayzata families who wanted their students to continue to participate in UMTYMP. However, there have been an increasing number of requests from families for this year, asking for preferential parking or to have their UMTYMP student released early from their 4th Block classes on a weekly basis.\u00a0The latter is especially unfortunate, amounting to 320 minutes of lost instructional time over the course of a semester.\""

"do you know when you'll be available to instruct this summer?"
"also, I'm making the schedules for AsKIP classes right now"
"could you whip up a flyer with askip information?"
"but rn i think we should start running emails out quickly"
"sorry for the delay, i've been swamped with ap tests"
"hey adhi"
"then give her an email template to send emails to parents"
"First, tell her to print out the flyer and give it to her students to take home"
"hm yeah\u2013I think we should work on a parent email and a flyer"
"especially because online school in the pandemic has forced many people to get the necessary materials to do online class"
"because that's more convenient and accessible for students"
"I was thinking we first offer the zoom class to sign up for"
"That way, students have the choice as to which one they attend"
"But we also offer an in-person program"
"We do classes this summer (or maybe even this may) thru zoom"
"Ok so basically this is my vision:"
"what do you think?"
"we write the email"
"we could just give the teachers a copy-paste email template"
"oh i know"
"but we also don't want to put too much work on the teacher's part, because everyone's lazy"
"that way, the kids will more likely sign up"
"we should tell teachers to offer the opportunity to students and inform their parents"
"so we're telling teachers to do someting"
"what do you think?"
"online classes allows for more accessbility from more students"
"I was planning for more online classes, but this summer, in-person may also be possible"
"OK Maybe we don't rush this"
"a camp at one of the schools may be too difficult to arrange"
"where we had classes over zoom"
"hmm I was thinking more of the thing we did last year"
"I was planning for a summer program"
"tell their parents + the students"
"maybe we do both?"
"advertising to parents is also fine"
"A good way to get kids to sign up is if their teachers tell them to"
"have the adults encourage attendance"
"tell teachers that she knows to tell their students about our program"
"or even better"
"ask her to tell students she knows about our program"
"if we don't get any replies, we'll just find more schools and send them"
"I'll handle sending out emails to the rest of those schools"
"I think rn you should contact that school u mentioned"
"yeah np"
"Do you have time to add some schools to the chart or revise the email draft today?"
"Hey Adhi, I think we should get everything ready by tmrw."
"we'll want to be done with this list and the school email draft by 4/20"
"I've already done like 7 schools, so just follow the format I used"
"could you get on the doc and add some schools to the list?"
"OK Adhi, when you get the time"
"there's a whole table set up"
"You should put the information for anoka hennepin MS on that doc"
"yeah I'm making the preparations for emailing rn"
"ayy that's sic k"
"And each time, we should try and send those emails to multiple teachers from the same school"
"99% of the time, the schools won't give us any reply, so we gotta send a bunch of emails"
"I think we should try to target schools to get the word out"
"let's start looking at how to get other students"
"so we should just get started without him"
"he's prlly not gonna respond"

Furthermore, I would put in thr necessary time to fulfill any obligations given.\n> In conclusion, I dunno know. I can be there."

I have been playing cricket for the past 7 years, although not through the Minnesota team. In addition, I am really motivated to encourage more participation in general in cricket. For example, Eric mentioned that the club was trying to get cricket into the school curriculum. I think that this would be an amazing idea and want to help as such. Thanks for considering me"

"it's just a lot of formal stuff"
"yea"
"btw (c) is yes and (d) is no"
"ahh sadg"
"have u done 13.2(b)?"
"ok"
"so d (a,b,c) = (ad,bd,cd)"
"oh it's scalar multiplication"
"lemme see"
"Do u wanna join Nooks?"
"R^3 is just (a, b, c) where a,b,c \\in R"
"f(a+bsqrt(2))=a-bsqrt(2)"
"i'll give u the ans so u can sleep lol"
"this one is non-identity"
"isnt it like 3am in ny"

"yes \ud83d\ude24"
"oh ok"
"or are u stuck on that too \ud83d\ude05"
"did u do 6c?"
"Hey Alice"
"m is an int"
"we alr proved that remember?"
"so f(x) = xf(1) for all x, so f(1)=k"
"So rationals hold"
"so division holds"
"so f(y/m) = f(y)/m"
"So mf(y/m) = f(y)"
"then, mf(x) = f(mx)"
"anyway, let x = y/m"
"ok for 5, the cont is written in notes if u want to use it"
"oh wait ur asking abt 5"
"nf(x) = f(nx)"
"I just asked sally"
"OK basically"
"hold on a sec"
"hmm"
"is that (c)?"
"wait how would this prove (b)?"
"hmm"
"u mean q?"
"= f(qx)"
"which is f(x+x+...+x) by isomorphism"
"so f(x)+f(x)+...+f(x)"
"isn't that by addition?"
"hmm"
"for (b)?"
"did u solve that"
"i heard sally and u talking ab c?"
"oofy"
"anyway, did u solve 6b yet?"
"idk how cheuk managed to make that rigorous lol"
"Hold on imma write up 4"
"yeah I'm in nooks rn"
"but is k in the set?"

"lol tru"

"ho lee shet"
"lol this is sad"
"can you generalize smthng about 4sqrt(2) then?"
"you know that it's a root of x^2-2 right?"
"oof"
"it sounds right"
"wait wdym"
"lmao yeah i was abt to do that too"
"that's way simpler than it looked to me lol"
"bruh"
"wait is the spanning set for 2 just (1, sqrt(2), cubrt(2))?"
"if that whole number is 2, yeah"
"i just finished 1 lol"
"these computation problems must be hard af"
"LMAO"
"wait still?"
"I'm prolly rly behind lol"
"ok I just got started \ud83d\ude05"
"Idk about this def tho for sumac"
"In linear algebra, a spanning set is 2 vectors such that any point can be reached by a linear combo of the vectors"
"I\u2019ll lyk once I do"
"Ok I haven\u2019t started on the pset yet"
"lol no one finished it"
"you have to rule out the quadratic*cubic cases"
"same"
"hold on i can't check everything rn im in a meeting"
"and then you argue that part a, b, c cover all even perms"
"yeah that's what I said"
"I didn\u2019t \ud83d\ude05"
"Yeah it\u2019s a pretty short proof"
"That\u2019s how I argued it"
"3-cycles generate A5"
"Everything goes to 3 cycles"
"hey alice are you on 10?"
"hopefully TA Alice helps us"
"lmao yea"
"na I took a break after rick's offic ehour"
"but this could just be sleep deprivation  taking hold"
"it's kind of not ok"
"uh i'm on 10 rn"
"\ud83d\ude05"
"actually idk, dont listen to me"
"therefore, for any q(x)+<p(x)>, the sets are disjoint?"
"and also, any polynomial you add to it will not have any common factors with it"
"i think it's just a thrm"
"9.9 is any group lol"
"and that's my hint"
"but we proved in (a) that ..."
"9.9 tells you that there must be an element of G with order q"
"Then, there must be some prime q s.t q | k, q| |G|"
"so say that you have G = kp^n, where k is some number that is not divisible by p and is greater than 1"
"lol ok"
"oof we have 2"
"lmao same \ud83d\ude22"
"it's called \"Sleep Deprivation\""
"yeah this was the \"direct method\""
"he's trying to prove i think xy^b = y^p-b x"
"(xy^b) order is 2 or p by closure"
"wtf"
"wait it was that easy"
"LMAO true"
"yea wow"
"LOL as predicted"
"bruh no one's gonna volunteer for 10.7"
"but x mod x^3+x+1"
"oh i got 1 mod x^3 as well"
"oh i think it was mod x^3+x+1?"
"ye that's what I got"
"Do you want to hop into Nooks for discussion?"
"oop"
"have you finished 10.7?"
"ur trying to prove that every element a satisfies a^k-1=0"
"no, x is just a variable"
"ok so sawyer says he doesn't know how to prove it directly \ud83d\ude2d"
"hold on imma dm sawyer about this"
"lol yeah it's kind of elusive"
"but idk how to prove that the order of this is 2"
"u can just use a, where order(a)=2, and b, where order(b)=p, to generate the entire group"
"lmao i cheated and used cauchy's theorem"
"oh ok"
"oh yeah, but e.g for D_4, aren't there four such \"rotations\""
"wait wdym 1 a of degree p?"
"ab^n = (b^n)^{-1}(a^{-1}) = b^{p-n}a"
"if it's order 2, (ab^n)^2 = e"
"hmm"
"how?"
"but i can't figure that out"
"i think u have to show that ba^n order is 2"
"but if u want to prove it, u have to show that ba^n = a^{p-n}b"
"said \"That \\phi is bijective and operation preserving is left as an exercise to the reader\" LMAO"
"I uh"
"cuz f is defined on b^xa^m for one set of b and a"
"wait actually, idt u can assume that"

"oh yeah, that's true lol"
"can I talk to you later?"
"Hold on, i can't really look at the page rn"
"you don't need to consider that"
"but if you prove that every element in G can be expressed as b^ia^j for some 0 <= i <= 1 and 0 <= j <= p-1"
"OK, proving that prp^3 maps to something is kind of painful"
"LMAO he also just graded mine"
"yea basically"
"then, you can make an isomorphism"
"you need to prove that all elements in G can be expressed as b^ia^j for some 0 <= i <= 1 and 0 <= j <= p-1"
"basically, for (a), just consider contradiction"
"it's easy to overthink it"
"also, number 11 is way easier than it looks"
"I think you need to argue that, with your elements a having order p and b having order 2, that a^n maps to rho^n and ba^n maps to r rho^n"
"lmk if u want a hint or smthn"
"ahh ok"
"btw did u get 10?"
"ok i see"
"for number 11, does \"maximum multiplicative order\" just mean that, out of all elements a, we're considering the one with the biggest number?"
"hey alice"
"2. there isn't"
"consider the two cases: 1. there is an element of order 2p"
"ok so basically"
"don't do cayley table bash tho"
"but u can do it using the same method"
"yeah it is"
"i did 10"
"ah right \ud83d\ude4f"
"hey alice, for 10.10, are we assuming that G is a group?"
"lmao yeah"
"3. f and g have leading coeff 1"
"2. f and g share p-1 roots (1, 2, ..., p-1 by Fermat's)"
"1. f and g are both deg p-1"
"isn't it enough to show that"
"I think we have been overthinking it too much"
"Hey Alice, have you finished 10.9 yet?"
"Just find interesting topics"
"Idt u need to give proofs"
"or else it's not even a ring"
"for 7(c), are we assuming that it's modulo x^6?"
"Also, Alice"
"but maybe to be rigorous u could ig"
"I think they're given as rings"
"We can ask TA Alice today"
"But it\u2019s rly vague"
"I think they want to draw a connection to something else we learned"
"Idk actually"

"explicit consent, more public trust"
"bro this looks like my argument"
"Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nWe live in a world where technology is rapidly advancing, and with that comes new challenges for protecting the privacy of our citizens. The internet has become an integral part of our lives, and we rely on it for everything from communication to commerce. However, as we all know, the internet can also be a dangerous place, and it's vital that we take steps to protect the personal information of our citizens.\n\nThat is why I am proposing an opt-in legislative solution to protecting online user privacy. This solution would give individuals the ability to control their personal information and decide for themselves what information they want to share online.\n\nUnder this proposal, companies would be required to obtain explicit consent from users before collecting, using, or sharing their personal information. This would include things like browsing history, location data, and personal details such as name and address.\n\nAdditionally, this proposal would also give users the ability to access, correct, and delete their personal information at any time. And companies would be required to disclose any data breaches to affected users in a timely manner.\n\nThis opt-in solution would not only protect the privacy of our citizens but also promote trust between individuals and companies. It would also encourage innovation and competition in the online space, as companies would have to work harder to gain and retain users' trust.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe this opt-in legislative solution is a crucial step towards protecting the privacy of our citizens in the digital age. I urge you to support this proposal, and let's work together to keep our citizens safe online. Thank you."

"Hyperinflation: It's massive inflation, out-of-control inflation (over 50% per month). It occurs when a lot of money is being printed (as was in Germany in 1923).\n\nDeflation is when existing dollars GAIN value. It occurs when overall prices decrease, which creates more expectations that prices will decrease, which further decreases prices. This creates an economic downturn and depression.\n\nStagflation is when inflation AND an increase in unemployment occurs. Occurs when the output stays stagnant while prices rise.\n\nPrice stability is very important as an economic goal. It ensures that people's livelihoods are retained, that they have the resources to purchase necessities, and that people have the incentive to work."
"The Unemployment rate does not encapsulate all of the workers who were displaced by the pandemic\u2013\u2013if they technically \"leave\" the labor force, they are not counted in the unemployment rate\nLabor force participation rate is the percentage of people in the population who partake in the labor force. It's important to see how well the unemployment rate applies to the actual number of people without jobs.\nFull employment is fairly important as an economic goal, since it ensures that one of the factors of production\u2013\u2013labor\u2013\u2013is being utilized efficiently.\n I wonder how the labor force will recover after the pandemic. If so many people left, how will the economy recover?"
"Productivity leads to more numerous and more efficient production of goods. But more production means that there's a higher supply for people to buy, and it accelerates the economy. This leads to economic growth. Additionally, with increased production, the GDP will also grow.\n\nCountries can increase productivity by developing technology\u2013\u2013using the factors of production in a more efficient manner.\n\nA higher GDP is generally correlated with a higher standard of living since more resources are available to the civilians.\n\nEconomic growth is pretty important as an economic goal for a country. This ensures that the country continues to innovate and improve the lives of its citizens. It keeps the country moving forward."

"u write a bunch of essays and stuff to apply for a scholarship"

So I would have liked to see even more significant changes. Another quick check I like for contamination is to plot the accuracy by year (or maybe groups of years), to see if models do better on older than newer problems\nI'm also thinking maybe we remove the part about the significant change in our paper?

Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\nSolution:\nLet's think step by step The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nLet's think step by step We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nLet's think step by step If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n...\nFind the least number $A$ such that for any two squares of combined area 1, a rectangle of area $A$ exists such that the two squares can be packed in the rectangle (without interior overlap).

"we could do 1/2 are easy, 3/4 medium, 5/6 hard?"
"so problem 1 is easy, 2 is harder, etc. until 6 is the hardest"
"I think, in general, the putnam exam orders the problems from easy to difficult"
"should we vary problems if we have to rewrite the entire solution?  I think it's definitely possible, but it's going to take a while"
"for instance, 2023 B2 has a factorization: 2023 = 7*17^2, which would be completely messed up if we chose 2022 or 2021"
"because some problems are very constant-specific, so changing the constant would vary the solution a lot more than just changing around some of the numbers"
"I think emily, bruno, and I will need to discuss a bit on how to do more significant variations"
"I was thinking: would a tetrahedron also fulfill this condition, as its coordinates have a factor of sqrt(3)"
"because the solution simply relies on the irrationality of the coordinates, which makes the vectors of a{1}v{1} + ... + a{12} v{12} infinitely dense on R^3"

"that's cool"
"\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af"

"yk my paper"
"bro \ud83d\ude2d"

"like for diagrams and shit"
"i always use figures"
"i see"
"do u put it in a figure?"
"if u use asy"
"smh"
"i see u are not a man of visuals m"
"yeah applied m"
"like figures make ur paper pretty"
"but even still"
"it's what my hmc mentor told me"
"ig"
"so having them is like"
"and look for figures and tables"
"they'll just scroll thru ur paper"
"people won't even look at content"
"like a lot of the time"
"like it's not even for the necesity"
"bro ok"
"u need figures bro"
"bro?"
"so there woudl be a ton of white space"

"figures got messed up m"

"i just stuck with the default template"

"bro is just a minimalist bro"
"HAHAHAHAHA"
"maybe we're looking at diff versions"
"it's two columned"
"is that default??"
"yeah this paper is very analysisy"
"at least from what ive heard"
"coding theory is more algebra m"
"i think ur right about that"
"what did tt do in info thry"
"ofc there are other areas"
"so like cryptography"
"i mean it deals with communicating info right?"
"applied nt m"
"that's kinda nt related right?"
"wait information theory??"
"lemme try to find it"
"i remember seeing a super highly cited paper"
"or maybe he initiated the field of signal reconstruction with that method or smth"

"bro"
"terrence tao bor"
"how tf"
"bro"
"wtf"
"holy fuck"
"sometimes it's about quality over quality + quantity m"

"so B has h index of 1"
"that one paper is all person B publishes"
"and doesn't do anything else"
"person B proves the twin prime conjecture"
"each of those papers gets cited 20 times"
"person A proves 20 mediocre theorems in 20 papers"
"right"
"ok let's say"
"u get me?"
"is more impactful than a higher h index"
"like a one hit wonder solving a centuries-old problem"
"but like comparatively right"
"h index is a measure of how good researcher u are"
"bro ok"
"LMFAO"
"one hit wonder bro"
"that's the only thing i heard of him doing"

"didnt his grad students get credit tho?"

"why u anti wiles"
"im wiles stan bro"
"no"
"WHAT"

"yeah this is the entire basis of mit research programs LMAO"
"but to like understand ur research m"
"that people usually think of in pure math research"
"like the big fish"

"> \"Why do people enjoy cock and ball torture? The act of intentionally or accidentally bringing pain upon the male genitals is typically a thought that people wince at with great force. However, there is a reason why this is an enjoyable experience. One rooted in the most important of sciences. Physics. Take, for example, a bottle of Tobasco Sauce. If one where to move the bottle up and down in a motion reminiscent to the one used during male self-stimulation it typically results in a moderate amount of sauce exiting the bottle. If struck hard on the bottom, however, a large amount will spurt out. Should this be done with the name genitals, turning them upside down and then striking the bottom of the scrotum with moderate to immense force, this will result in a large amount of seed to be ejected from the penis due to the energy being transferred from the palm of the hand to genitals. Therefore, because of physics and the transfer of energy from palm to the genitals, cock and ball torture is a scientifically pleasurable experience.\" - Tika Kude, Computer Science Professor at the Princeton of the West"

"> Dr. Calder maintains neutrality throughout the notes. Yet, because these are meant for a level 5000 math course at the University of Minnesota, he omits some details that a purely neutral writer may not have. For instance, Dr. Calder assumes a deep knowledge of linear algebra and calculus. Moreover, Dr. Calder undoubtedly leaves out many technical details that could be too complex for a senior undergrad audience. More importantly, however, due to Dr. Calder\u2019s applied mathematical viewpoint, the lecture notes mostly focus on how the mathematical tools of linear algebra and vector calculus can be applied to real-world problems in machine learning and data analysis. There are plenty of pure-math related details about linear algebra that Dr. Calder omits. For instance, during one of our meetings, I asked Dr. Calder about inverse matrices and why they are not in the lecture notes; Dr. Calder told me that, because matrices in this context are often extremely massive, it is highly impractical to compute inverse matrices. He also told me that most of the elements of matrices in this context are 0, and to save space, computers usually only store nonzero values. This means that inverse matrices are essentially useless, even though they are invaluable in pure linear algebra."

"Dr. Calderer\u2019s research, like Dr. Calder\u2019s above, is in an applied area of mathematics; in particular, she has published many papers in the areas of mathematical biology\u2013applying mathematics to solve biological problems\u2013 and mathematical physics.\n\nIn particular, for her focus on mathematical physics, Dr. Calderer focuses on the analysis of liquid crystals and the different properties of gels.\n\nBoth the fact that Dr. Calderer is a tenured professor and that she has an extensive list of publications suggest that she has a lot of research experience. \n\nFurthermore, though applied mathematics is not a field that I have explored much so far, I believe that it is a very feasible path to follow in research; after all, unlike in pure mathematics, where the \u201cusefulness\u201d of a finding is rarely apparent until many years later when that finding is finally utilized in some real-world discovery (Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, for instance, used hyperbolic geometry. This non-Euclidean form of geometry was created almost a century before Einstein\u2019s theory), mathematicians in applied mathematics get to see the relevance of their work almost immediately. It is, therefore, a field that would be beneficial for me to do exploration in.\n\nDr. Calderer\u2019s specific interest in mathematical biology\u2013exploring the knotting structure of DNA with algebraic topology\u2013aligns with some of my own background knowledge and seems very interesting to me. Mentorship with Dr. Calderer could definitely yield significant results."

I see Mcdonalds every time I drive my car on the road. I live in a smaller area and there are plenty of McDonalds!. Once I saw two were next to each other! I went to Big Bear to have a nice winter, but a FUCKING MCDONALDS WAS THERE. I went to another country to stay there because I always wanted to go there. No McDonalds! but there was a new problem.

In the event that there is an error for your schedule** (e.g. not playing three different packets per major or playing in two rooms at the same time), please let us know ASAP. Hopefully, this will prevent any confusion on tryout day.\n\nAnd just as a reminder, please be courteous and respectful during tryouts.\n\nBest of luck to everyone!"

"There are many reasons why climate change is real and why we need to take action against it. Plentiful evidence exists showing that current warming trends are far above the normal warming/cooling cycles of the Earth\u2019s climate over geologic time. Furthermore, looking at the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we can see that they have experienced a sharp upwards spike within the past century or so, and are continuing to skyrocket. Finally, we can look at sea ice levels in the arctic and antarctic. They have plunged below recorded levels, meaning that the poles of our planet are warming up and melting. This\u2013\u2013along with the warming itself\u2013\u2013could have major implications for our planet. These include higher-intensity storms, droughts, and coastal flooding"

"can we plan to meet this weekend? <@107567950428405760> <@689487153834885234>"
"once i'm finished with that stuff tmrw, i'll be able to finish up the proof"
"Hey, sorry, I haven't been working on the project the past few days cuz i've been busy with aps and scholarship application stuff"
"i haven't tried expanding this expression yet, but it looks like you could cancel some terms"
"In this case, we have the expression $$k^2 ((q_{12} \\overline{r_{12}}^2 + 2|q_{12}||r_{12}| + (\\overline{q_{12}}r_{12})^2) - 64 (\\cos_q^2 - \\sin_q^2 q_{11}^2)(\\cos_r^2 - \\sin_r^2 r_{11}^2) \\le 0$$"
"It looks like last time we were trying to find c <= 0 when we should've been considering c^2-4ab <= 0"
"<@689487153834885234> could you write the second case for the proof where Q and R are reflections?"
"Whiteboard from today's meeting"
"does the paper look good?"
"yepp!!"
""
"Here's the paper"
"we should send this to Pavel sometime soon"
"ok i've finished the writeup"
"not necessarily same magnitude"
"oh wait, i suppose not"
"in other words, how do we get from $r_{12}r_{21} = m^2-1$ to $r_{12} = \\mu \\sqrt{m^2-1}$ and $r_{21} = \\mu^{-1} \\sqrt{m^2-1}$"
"How do we know that r_12 and r_21 have the same magnitude"
"Wait <@107567950428405760>"
"silver linings"
"yes!"
"ig that settles it then"
"oh well"
"ohhhh shoot"
"yess"
"but we're not using discriminant here"
"the eigenvalues of R_0 are lambda_R and lambda_R^-1, which have magnitude strictly 1"
"why is that"
"more like to the right of that parabola shape"
"but it's to the upper right of that parabola shape"
"ohhh haha we were rly messy with the whiteboard today sorry"
"and equated that to 1?"
"we squared the two and added them together"
"and sqrt(r11^2- blah blah)/2 is the imag part"
"so, (r11+r22)/2 is the real part"
"we're utilizing the fact that the roots are complex conjugates of each other and are of magnitude 1"
"ok in that step"
"is our proof solid, then?"
"yes, that means 1 - a^2 <= r12r21"
"2 <= 2a^2 + 2r12r21"
"i think this works out"
"so since 2a^2 >= r11^2+r22^2"
"ugh my brain is not working right now"
"i typed this wrong"
""
"wait no..."
"hahaha at least this means that we don't have to make the radical change"
"we messed up the logic for a"
"oh \ud83d\ude2d"
"did i type something wrong or did we do something wrong"
"oh wait"
"if a < 1, then r12r21 < 0"
"wait what?"
"thus, D = c^2-4ab = 0 - 0 = 0"
"meaning that c = 0"
"then, since a = 0 AND P,Q are reflections, we have P = +/- Q, meaning that Q is also diagonal in this basis"
"however, if we include the fact that Q is a reflection, we get a = 0"
"here, i was trying some stuff out and it doesn't seem that P being a reflection ALONE is enough to get D <= 0"
"Now all that's left is the determinant c^2-4ab"
"the two cases are symmetric"
"we can similarly conclude that a >= 0 without even using the fact that Q is a reflection"
"Ergo, b >= 0 comes directly from the fact that P is a reflection"
"but r11r22 = a^2, and we just showed that a >= 1"
"for r11r22 - 1 >= 0, we need r11r22 >=1"
"Remember, we have r11r22 - r12r21 = 1 from the determinant of R_0"
"for b>= 0, we need r11r22 -1 >= 0"
"after simplification, this is just 4r11r22-4"
"b is sigma^2 + r^2 - 4"
"Now, notice what \"b\" in pavel's proof is in this case"
"from these two expressions, we have a >= 1"
"we also have a^2 -1 = r12 r21"
"anyway"
"yes"
"from (r_11 + r_22) \\in R and (r_11 - r_22) \\in i * R, we see that r11 and r22 are complex conjugates of each other"
"oh wait i see"
"hold on"
"first off, the trace of R_0 is real since it's lambda_R + lambda_R^-1"
"by the trace conditions"
"we have 1-a^2 >= r12r21 from the fact that the eigenvalues of R_0 are lambda_r and lambda_r^-1\u2013\u2013which are complex conjugates of each other and magnitude 1"
"Now, we have an interesting set of equations"
"sorry i miswrote"
"from this, 1-a^2 >= r12r21"
"to get 2r12 r21 + 2a^2 >= 2"
"we substitue r11^2+r22^2 <= 2a^2 into r11^2 +2r12r21 + r22^2 = 2"
"but anyway"
"because of confusion we named it \"m\" in our writeup"
"not pavel's a"
"this is the a in your expression for R"
"so continuing this"
"but i can explain it briefly via discord rn"
"ill probably finish tomorrow"
"i'm writing it up rn but im rly tired haha"
"or, at least, what we have strictly uses the fact that p and q are reflections"
"i believe we were able to prove that they don't exist thru contradiction"
"which would mean that the trace of Q_0 is not necessarily 0"
"it seems we can get a>= 0 without assuming that q is a reflection"
"since r11 and r22 are complex conjugates of each other (with magnitude a), we have r11^2 + r22^2 <= 2a^2"
"from the fact that the eigenvalues of R_0 are complex conjugates of each other with magnitude 1, we have the expression r11^2 +2r12r21 + r22^2 = 2"
"then, from the determinant, we have a^2-1= r12r21"
"we utilize the fact that r11r22 is real and the fact that r11+r22 is real and r11-r22 is pure imag to deduce that r11 and r22 are complex conjugates"
"the math is rigorous"
"Indeed,  this means that our original condition is a subset of Pavel's condition"
"is \"t\" the same \"t\" that we defined in the proof?"
"wait what?"
"how do we know that there's a common gamma factor?"
"in this equation"
"<@107567950428405760> I am slightly confused by how you got the forms of r_12 and r_21 can be calculated"
"ohh okok i see"
"I'm gonna put it into the paper and shoot it off to pavel soon"
"wait was there anything wrong with our solution?"
"so are THESE guaranteed to be all of the solutions?"
"ahh that\u2019s very interesting"
"then, using that and the assumption that the matrix R is diagonal to see"
"then seeing that it must be 1i based on tau^2 = 4"
"then deducing that q11 is pure imag from the trace condition"
"what i had was essentially assuming that Q is a reflection and then seeing that q11 = -q22"
"ahh i see"
"how does that imply this?"
"hmmm okok"
""
"it's one of the preliminary conditions that we obtained the discriminant condition from"
"ok that makes the proof much simpler than whatever i had HAHA"
"ohhhh i didnt knwo that fact"
"ahh i was assuming that P was diagonalized but that Q was just a reflection"
"ohh i didnt assume that"
"and we have the relation r12 = r21 |t|^2 from above"
"since q12 r21 is 0, we know that at least one of q12 and r21 is 0"
"oh, so the roots are q_{12}r_{21} and q_{21}r_{12} right"
"yepp"
"it turns out that both of them have to be 0"
"since the roots are both 0, one of q_12 and r_12 has to be 0"
"I think I concluded that r_11 and r_22 were lambda_R and lambda_R^-1 from the discriminant being 0"
"yes that follows fairly straightforwardly"
"basically anytime after 1:50 PM CST"
"yes i am"
"it's a little confusing to me atm"
"Could we meet tonight to discuss this over a zoom call?"
"yes!"
"can we use the contrapositive of \"these two conditions are both true ---> the matrices are in this form\""
"and we're guaranteed that for everything else that the two conditions don't overlap"
"ahh so we are in agreement!"
"haha no worries"
"ohh |lambda_R| = 1, so lambda_R^-1 = lambda_R conj"
"u mean the diagonal elements should be  ((lambda_R conj, 0) , (0, lambda_R^-1 conj))?"
"these came necessarily from the combined conditions that the inequalities are satisfied and two of them are reflections (unless I made an error, which is possible)"
"and this is true for any lambda_R"
"I found that P = ((i,0),(0,-i)), Q = ((i,0),(0,-i)), and R = ((lambda_R, 0) , (0, lambda_R^-1)) satisfy the inequalities"
"wait how did you get that?"
"indeed, it seems that if P, Q, and R are all diagonal in the same basis, we can satisfy Pavel's quadratic inequalities while simultaneously having two of them be reflections"
"but if we have P and Q as the reflections, and we let R be a diagonal matrix in the same basis as P, we can formulate a Q such that this works"
"ok! i havent finished that section cuz i was thinking about it"
"I worked out something for two reflections that seems to work"
"sounds good"
"Is that always true that if the magnitudes of the eigenvalues of a matrix are 1 and that its determinant is 1, that the magnitude of the column vectors are also 1?"
"I remember we said something about the column vectors of Q having to have magnitude 1?"
"as far as I can tell, there's nothing wrong about this case"
"equivalently, if both r_12 and r_21 are 0, the same"
"so if q_12 and q_21 are both 0, then both the roots of the quadratic are 0"
"I was looking at it, and it only requires that one of the other matrices is also diagonalized"
"Wait <@107567950428405760> why is it that when P and Q are reflections that the discriminant condition doesn't  hold?"
"let's write up what we found in the paper then"
"yeah ur prolly right"
"I guess we  could also send along the actual paper file"
"Here's the email I'm going to send to Pavel, shoudl I add/remove anything?"
"@everyone"
"which breaks the discriminant condition"
"oh wait no, when a = 0, one of the roots of the quadratic is 0"
"so it's only in the case where strictly 2 of the matrices are reflections that we differ"
"so when all three matrices are reflections, it seems that we're fine?"
"doesn't the discriminant condition hold no matter what"
"wait guys, when gamma = 1"
"\"Zitzewitz\" \ud83d\ude2d"
"OK"
"I remember learning that it is"
"Also, is math paper author ordering alphabetical?"
"Here's the whiteboard from our meeting today"
"yes I think so"
"yeahh so we can replace that case with an analysis of why |p| <=2"
"and it is magnitude 1"
"yess and \\lambda_p is real if |p|>2"
"unfortunate"
"Also <@689487153834885234> for some reason the whiteboard didnt save"
"meaning that P_0 is  a reflection"
"and also, in the second case, after conjugation, lambda has to be \\pm 1 as well"
"and so |p|> 2 actually can't exist because that would mean that lambda = \\pm 1"
"so first, lambda in both |p| > 2 and |p|<2 satisfies lambda = lambda_p"
"we kinda wanna talk about this with u"
"<@107567950428405760> We found some very strange things with Pavel's proof"
"just not necessarily as strong as saying that two of the matrices have to be reflections"
"so basically, stronger conditions do exist for unitarity"
"the discriminant condition seems to be necessary"
"and <@107567950428405760> , I believe this answers my original question"
"we were trying to prove that this condition is unnecessary"
"Pavel's \"Proposition 1\" lists the r^2-4pq >= 0 term as a part of its hypothesis IN ADDITION to the trace conditions"
"<@689487153834885234> I believe we were trying to do something impossible yesterday"
"sure here it is"
"implies unitarity for all monodromy matrices P,Q,R"
"As in, are we guaranteed that this trace condition"
"Are there additional conditions for the case where |p|<2 other than the trace conditions we specified in the theorem hypothesis?"
"I'm a little bit confused on the last part, though"
"<@107567950428405760> I've essentially finished transcribing the proof into the paper"
"this is a very clever transformation"
"ahhh i see"
"HAHA ur very correct"
"ohhh"
"i think i might've inputted something wrong"
""
"but it looks like the identity transformation?"
"i'm using matlab to do the bashing"
"haha yess"
"oh wait.. let me see"
"so like we can guarantee that b_11 and b_22 are real"
"Wouldn't that change the ones that are already real to complex values?"
"How do we do this? I think this is the step we were stuck on before taking the assumption that two of the matrices are reflections"
""
"\"the way that Pavel justifies that the matrices are real is \"by rescaling basis vectors, we can make sure that c_21 \\in \\Real...\""
"<@107567950428405760> oh also"
""
"thanks Dave"
"OK everything is fine!"
"yess"
"the eigenvalues are 1 and lambda_P^2"
"i didnt see the 2"
"im stupid"
"OHH"
"determinant = prod of eigenvalues"
"wait hold on"
"ohh hahaha"
"we do P/lambda_P^1/2?"
"wait so how would that work out?"
"in our case N=2"
"oh but then they wouldnt be real..."
"and lambda_Q^1/2 and lambda_R^1/2"
"i think we can make it work by dividing thru by lambda_P^1/2"
"OK Sure"
"we'd have to do P/(lambda_P^1/2)"
"then P/lambda_P wouldnt have det 1"
"hmm"
"wait so det(P) = \\lambda_P^2?"
"ok so the eigenvalues of P are 1 and lambda_P right"
"ohh i see"
"wait hmm"
"wouldn't that make the determinant -1?"
"Because without the restriction that any of them are reflections, we have no control over their eigenvalues"
"Can we guarantee that our monodromy matrices will have determinant 1?"

"I found something odd"
"<@107567950428405760> I'm going through Pavel's proof of the more general theorem rn"

"OK, so I did a bit of work on the algorithm yesterday"
"(i.e we want the trace to lie on the line with the same angle as the product of the lambdas)"
"Basically, instead of wanting $t_{12} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we want $\\frac{t_{12}}{|t_{12}|} = e^{\\pi i (2-\\gamma - \\delta)}$"
"<@107567950428405760> OK I'm thinking about the refining the algorithm thing"
""
"food is temporary, math is forever"
"You should skip dinner lol"
"oof ok"
"which is in a little over a month \ud83d\ude05"
"Also, we prolly need to start putting more hours on this project in August because the Yau deadline is 9/05"
"<@689487153834885234> hbu?"
"I'm fine with that!"
"but luckily, we have all of that material already written \ud83d\ude04"
"I don't know if we want to include the definition of monodromy in our paper, since the people at the competitions may not be familiar with this very niche subject"
"OK I grinded out the beginning part of the introduction"
"I'll see you guys at 4PM CT"
"I think I'm going to just start on item 3/4, then."
"I've done some searching, and I can't find any trace identities that would be helpful to us"
"OK Sounds good!"
"1. Refine the algorithm to find values for which the group G _could_ be unitary\n\n2. Do Beukers' \"straightforward calculation\" \ud83d\ude2d . Dave will contact Beukers by Wednesday if we don't find anything\n\n3. Finish Presentation\n\n4. Start writing up the actual paper to prepare for the Yau and ISEF competitions"
"so, from what I've gathered from the meetings, this is the list:"
"what we should be aiming for"
"OK guys, I think we should list an objectives list"
"aight sg"
"about trace identities?"
"hmmm sure"
"I'm not sure where u were thinking about going next"
"$t_{A} t_{BC} + t_{B} t_{CA} + t_{C} t_{AB} -t_A t_B t_C = 0$"

"Our working notes: https://www.overleaf.com/3372696355dscpxczmyxjz"
"so yes, exactly one is positive"
"mb"
"I see what u mean"
"oh waitt"
"It\u2019s supposed to be a^2+b^2+c^2+abc=0"
"The sum is negative- you used a different expression"
"like even for the lame equation"
"do we know literally anything about t_P0Q0 t_Q0R0 and t_P0R0"
"So hm"
"or all of them, right?"
"not $a^2+b^2+c^2-abc$"
"<@689487153834885234> Remember, it's $a^2+b^2+c^2 +abc$"
"We should also write down proofs in case we end up using one of them"
"I\u2019m on a walk rn, but imma put the ineq I found in there when I get back"
"Yeah that\u2019s kind of our notes doc at this point"
"In case any of them are useful"
"We should write these down"
"Ok ok"
"Yes"
"see what other properties you can tell about a,b,c"
"Alex, could you play around with $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 0$?"
"one of them is larger than 9, that's for sure"
"which is ugly"
"but we have to use a WLOG there"
"but it might be helpful in seeing how Beukers' identity is actually true"
"I don't know where this is useful"
"mhm"
"and $\\alpha = 1/4$, so this is $e^{-\\pi i} = -1$"
"you get $e^{-2\\pi i (2 \\alpha)}"
"no, because if you multiply all 3 lambdas"
"do you mean like the +tP0Q0 tQ0R0 stuff?"
"it's not letting me click"
"ahh sorry i cant see which msg ur replying to"
"is that useful tho"
"which gets us to $abc \\leq -27$"
"and that yields $\\sqrt[3]{-1/abc} \\leq 1/3$"
"Now, everything on the LHS is a positive real number, so we can apply AMGM"
"$-a/bc + -b/ac + -c/ab = 1$"
"so we can write:"
"but ok, since $abc$ is negative, we know that $a/bc, b/ac, c/ab$ are all negative"
"or everything is $0$ and we don't care about anything"
"OK from $a^2+ b^2 + c^2 + abc = 0$, we know that $abc$ must be negative"
"$a/bc + b/ac + c/ab = -1$"
"we get"
"ok basically divide by $abc$ on both sides"
"lemme just type it out cuz im on a roll rn and i dont wanna stop the momentum"
"do u see where this goes?"
"yeah"
"and then a,b,c are real, so"
"$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = -abc$"
"we get"
"move abc to the RHS"
"$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 0$"
"and we get"
"we let $t_{P_0 Q_0} = a, t_{Q_0 R_0} = b, t_{P_0 R_0} = c$"

"$\\sum t_{P_0Q_0}^2 + t_{P_0 Q_0} t_{Q_0 R0} t_{P_0 R_0} = 0$"
"OK, then because we know that $\\gamma = \\delta = \\epsilon = 1/2$ in the Lam\u00e9 equation, we have:"
"$e^{2\\pi i (2- \\gamma - \\delta)}  t_{P_0 Q_0}^2 + blah blah blah - e^{2\\pi i (2\\alpha)} t_{P_0 Q_0} t_{Q_0 R_0} t_{P_0 R_0} = 0$"

"and expand the lambdas"
"We factor out the lambdas"
"$t_{PQ}^2 + t_{QR}^2 + t_{PR}^2 - t_{PQ} t_{QR} t_{PR} = 0$"
"This means that"
"from above, we know that the LHS and RHS of Beukers' identity equal 0"
"OK this is another long series of logic but basically:"
"sorry, I had to go into a meeting"
"it's pretty complicated"
"AMGM inequality"
"for the Lam\u00e9 Equation, at least"
"$t_{P_0 Q_0} t_{Q_0 R_0} t_{P_0 R_0} \\leq -27$"

"with the identity"
"I found something interesting"
"np!"

"OK Anyway, that's pretty  cool"
"we know that the eigenvalues $a,b$ of $P_0 Q_0 R_0$ satisfy $a+b = 1, ab = 1$, making them $\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i$"

"This means that $\\tr(P_0 Q_0 R_0) = 1$"

"Then $dx^2 = 2/z^3 dz^2$"
"$dx = -1/z^2 dz$"
"we set $x = 1/z$ and then"

"Dear Professor Etingof, I hope this email finds you well.\n\nI\u2019m writing this email to provide you with an update to our PRIMES research and make a request.\n\nFirstly, we have made great progress on the research question. After a LOT of background reading and problem solving, we\u2019ve grasped the concept of a monodromy and monodromy group. We\u2019ve understood the Darboux equation\n\nIn particular, we\u2019ve been able to transform the Darboux equation into an algebraic form:\nWe\u2019ve successfully traversed important sections of Beukers\u2019 2007 paper about finding unitary monodromy groups. We\u2019ve successfully emulated Beukers\u2019 \u201cgradient descent\u201d method in the numerical data section of his paper to create an algorithm in Python that can accurately approximate the eigenvalues that yield unitary monodromy groups for any form of the Heun Equation (the general form of the Lam\u00e9 and Darboux equations). We uploaded this code onto this Github repository:\nhttps://github.com/ericc2023/DarbouxSimulation.\n\nHowever, Alex, Dave, and I are currently extremely busy. Personally, I have a summer camp that runs from 6/12-6/18, entirely covering the 6/15 deadline. As such, we don\u2019t forecast that we can create a quality Interim Report by the 6/15 deadline. Is it possible for us to have a small, 7-day extension on the deadline?"

"<@107567950428405760> <@689487153834885234> I did some brief calculations"
"I think at our meeting today, we could talk about how these local exponents can apply to a monodromy group"
"Yeah we could def include this in our paper"
"Here's a simple curve version"
""
"This is just something I whipped up in Geogebra"
"Yeah I can"
"But it could very well be a positive angle as well"
"So cuz here alpha is not necessarily equal to beta, I made it not tangent"
"I thought Beukers was tangent because in his case, alpha = beta"
"the angle between the two arcs is (alpha - beta)2pi"
"the angle between the horizontal line and the diagonal line is (1- gamma) 2pi"
"I set the line on the x axis to be between $a$ and $1$"
"this is just a random graph on arbitrary values of the parameters"
"What if gamma = 3/2 makes the Lame equation with a different n value"
"Brukers specified that his Lame equation was for the parameter n=-1/2"
"Another possibility:"
"So, depending on the parameters gamma, delta, epsilon, alpha, and beta, if we made a Schwarz map like Beukers did, it could look like this"

"<@107567950428405760> <@689487153834885234> what do you guys think?"
"and then we can restrict the parameters of the Heun Equation to make the Darboux equation"
"I think we can try applying Beuker's work to the Heun equation"
"hm ok. this is pretty interesting"
"the darboux equation is only a special case of it"
"and BTW, it seems that the Heun equation is a super powerful equation"
"because 3/2 cannot be a value of gamma, based on the fact that the local exponent would then be -1/2, which contradicts Beuker's work"
"so this means definitively that there is some kind of mishap going on here"
"(0, 1- gamma), (0, 1-delta), (0,1-epsilon), and (alpha,beta), respectively"
"so if this is our equation, the local exponents at 0, 1, a, and infinity are"

"I just realized that the local exponents were *right there on the wikipedia page of the Heun equation*"
"slight stupid on my part"
"OK so uh"
"I\u2019m talking about the coefficients of the heun equation (I.e the algebraic darboux equation)"
"cuz unlike with the Lame equation, at infinity, all the coefficients except for y'' vanish"
"Also <@107567950428405760> <@689487153834885234> , do either of you know how infinity is one of the singularities of the Darboux equation?"
"or maybe there's some clever combination of these that make a local exponent of 1/2"
"the exponents cannot ever be 3/2, since that would screw up the local exponents"
"OK, so I think we have to conclude that the people in that paper were wrong then"
"but cos(2sqrt(x))/sqrt(x) results in a local exponent of -1/2?"
"the sin(2sqrt(x)/sqrt(x) results in a local exponent of 0"
"This is the local solution when one of the coefficients is 3/2"
""
"but there is another thing to be sad about:"
"so i don't have to be sad anymore"
"ohh ok"
"even though according to Beukers they *should* be"
"so in other words, our local exponents may not be 0 and 1/2"
"so it's *not* constant?"

"$b^{*}$ is actually $\\lambda I_2$, where $\\lambda = b^{*}$?"
"so in that expression above"
"hmm OK"
"because I'm not sure that $g = b^{*} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\beta \\\\ \\gamma & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}$ is in either of these groups"
"Or does it mean linear combinations of the matrices within these two groups?"
"also, in Proposition 1, when it says \"generated by SL(2, \\Real) and the diagonal matrices \\lambda I_2,\" does it mean the union of these two groups?"
"that makes more sense"

"as in publishing? yes"
"if i do not use the problems for commercial/monetary purposes (and i explicitly state this), does this fall under \"fair use\"?"
"i'm currently making an eval benchmark of competition problems to test the reasoning abilities of machine learning models, and im concerned that the problems may be copyrighted"
"idk if ur still awake, but i had a quick question i wanted to ask u"
"also, dave"
"Say you are throwing darts at a circular dartboard. You throw two darts, and your second dart lands farther from the center than your first dart. Now, you throw a third dart. What is the probability that it also lands farther from the center than your first dart? Assume your skill level stays constant throughout, and each throw is independent.\n\nI immediately thought to use conditional probability to solve this question. Let the distances of the three darts be three random variables X, Y, Z. Then, this probability is:\n\nP(Z > X | Y > X) = P(Z > X and Y > X)/ P(Y > X).\n\nHere\u2019s was my solution: Since the throws are independent (in particular, Z and Y should be independent right?),  P(Z>X and Y>X) = P(Z>X) P(Y>X) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 (by symmetry). This makes the total probability 1/2.\n\nHowever, the real solution is: X,Y,Z can have any of 6 orderings with equal probability. In 3 of those orderings is Y>X, and in 2/3 of those orderings is Z>X. Thus, the probability is 2/3.\n\nWhat was wrong with my intuition about independence?"
"I have a quick question about a probability thing that I was hoping you could answer:"
"Hey Dave"
"alright tysm dave"
"im pretty sure he just wants to see something"
"haha, just any rec letter"
"tysm"
"once ur finished with the letter of rec, could u send a copy to brando9@stanford.edu?"

"what would be your \"title\"?"

"hey dave, what's a good email for u?"
"so we good"
"alright i emailed the director directly and she said i can use one external recommender"
"I don't know if SURIM allows external recommenders, and the organizers are ghosting my emails"
"also, the stanford university research institute in math (surim) summer program"
"I haven't fully cemented which programs I wanna apply to but im gonna just use the mathprograms.org interface"
"im planning to apply to some reus and programs n stuff"
"could u theoretically write a rec letter for me if ur not too busy lol"
"hey dave"
"but like there's this one program called SURIM which i have to apply for and is a summer research program"
"it's not as easy as mit with urop and stuff"
"LMAO yeah... i think that I'd probably have to work pretty hard to do math research at stanford"
"but we're already doing math research in *high school* so..."
"i emailed a few stanford profs and they told me \"something something math research is very difficult and you need a strong background in math before you can do research with us\""
"so like do undergrads usually do math research with professors?"
"Hey dave, i had a quick question"
"also, have u gone on a tangerine tour before?"
"apparently it's still really good but not AS good as MIT"
"have you heard anything about research ops at stanford"
"ohh wow"
"or is it something that just provides some funding"
"is urop just a program that matches professors with students then?"
"that\u2019s great news!"
"ahh i see"
"or is it something like a professor has a problem, and you're solving a sub-problem that contributes to an overall solution"
"is the research in UROP of high caliber? as in, is it something where I\u2013\u2013as the student\u2013\u2013am allowed to explore my own path and ideas (kind of like we're doing in PRIMES)?"
"but something I'm worried about is like UROP"
"because MIT definitely has a ton of opportunities that I could take advantage of"
"I think CPW made my decision between mit and stanford a lot harder"
"Thanks!"
"that's a lot of information Dave"

"I had a question"
"Hey Dave"
"I took a cryptology class at the University of Minnesota and my professor used to do research for AT&T"
"oh yeah i bet"
"i'm thinking of continuing cryptography research in college"
"Yep I will haha"
"Thank you, Dave!"
"Ahh I see"
"like most prominently is RSA, but you could also think about postquantum algorithms like lattice-based"
"is it possible for machine learning to break encryption?"
"Hey Dave, I don't know if you can say anything about this but"
"Yeah I bet \ud83d\ude2d"
"i'm trynna do a little exploring of post quantum crypto haha"
"Thanks, Dave!"
"yeah based on e=mc^2"
"haha I see"
"wait... so the mass of the electron and positron are converted into the energy of the photons?"
"ohhh that's very interesting..."
"is this kind of like the lattice you were talking about?"
"it's RSA with an extension of integer rings"
"I was reading this paper the other day: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1170568/FULLTEXT01.pdf"
"cuz electrons can't cancel out by conservation of mass"
"yess that's what I thought"
"how do electrons cancel each other out in a double slit experiment? Is it the electrons themselves that are interfering or their probability waves? (i.e if two probability waves cancel out, the probability that an electron occurs in a location is 0, meaning that there won't be any electrons there)"
"second, which is in a completely different field"
"but iirc classical symmetric cryptosystems aren't"
"I know that factorization-based cryptosystems like RSA are at risk"
"first, I've been looking into cryptography research for fun, and I was wondering if you could make a cryptosystem with complex numbers that won't be broken by the development of quantum computers"
"well, 2 actually"

"also, do you have the rec letter ready? I plan to send it out tonight"
"as in their reputation?"
"yes, that is what i was thinking as well\u2013\u2013however, if they don't have rights, are we going to damage MATH?"
"additionally, if it's more convenient to talk about this in person, do you want to have a meeting sometime?"
"sorry for the spam, by the way\u2013\u2013we're all pretty nervous about this issue"
"let me know which one of these you think is the best path forward"
"3. Email the MAA asking about the MATH dataset (whether they had rights or not). In this email, don\u2019t mention the Putnam dataset. In this way, we gauge whether or not MATH had express permission. Using this information, we can then make a more informed decision about whether to use Plan A or Plan B.\n4. Email Hendrycks to inquire about whether they asked the MAA for legal permissions. Since our project is so similar to theirs, mimicking their course of action may be our safest bet as their dataset is already established and well-known."
"1. Email the MAA for permission/forgiveness to use the dataset. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll draw more sympathy if we mention that we\u2019ve already created the dataset, and that we\u2019ve spent many months on this project. Furthermore, we should mention that our use for non-commercial research falls completely under Fair Use, and that we\u2019re only reaching out **because we want to be safe**. If the MAA responds positively we are free of any legal questions. However, if the MAA responds otherwise, this may jeopardize our entire project. The AMS specifies that any usage of their work must be under a license from the AMS (MAA may have similar policies though we were unable to find any)\n2. Publish the dataset with a similar Legal Compliance notice as the MATH dataset paper. In this case, it\u2019s somewhat likely that we won\u2019t receive any legal trouble from the MAA, as they don\u2019t seem to have taken legal action against MATH in the three years since its release. However, it may be a potential source of trouble in the future. Interestingly, we noticed that the MATH dataset\u2019s claim that the AoPS uses the MAA\u2019s problems without their permission is wrong. Indeed, AoPS explicitly thanks the MAA for \u201callowing [them] to use a selection of their problems\u201d in all of their books."

"usually i've heard that to get things done, it's \"better to ask for forgiveness than permission\""
"otherwise, we may not get in other conferences either"
"but given that NeurIPS rejected our paper partially on the basis of us not having legal rights, i think we should ask for permission"
"yes, you're correct"

"I've messaged him this morning, but he hasn't responded yet"
"what should we do?"
"I was just reading through the NeurIPS reviews for our Putnam-MATH paper, and I realized that we may not have the **legal rights** to publish Putnam problems"
"Hey Prof. Koyejo!"
"and, while we're more concerned with the latter, fine tuning an open source model would only tell us about the former"
"another thing: it looks like the effect of memorization through fine tuning may be different from the effect of memorization through training"
"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06714"
"i see, so should we mention this in our paper: that any drop in performance in the variations could be attributable to token sensitivity as well as memorization?"
"because, after running our equivalence function which equates \\frac{}{}, \\sqrt{}, and other mathematical/algebraic expressions, our eval code expects an exact string match"
"hmm, we do evaluations by matching the boxed answer at the end of the model's response. could that be affected by token sensitivity?"
"wait, just to clarify, token sensitivity = you change a couple tokens in the prompt and the LLM gives a vastly different answer?"
"we haven't really considered that factor"
"I'm not sure how to evaluate token sensitivity?"
"if we run the variation problems on a model fine tuned to our originals, we can also see the reasoning capability: it would probably get a lot more questions wrong"
"like simulating data contamination"
"fine tuning could probably show the effect of memorization"
"Thank you so much! \ud83d\ude4f"
"yes, definitely should be one of our next steps"
"would that work?"
"and then seeing whether that affects the performance"
"brando suggested fine tuning an open source model on our dataset"
"as in: assuming the variable changes get the same accuracy, the constant changes trip up the model, overall accuracy would lower"
"however, because the constant changes are included in our variation dataset (they're around 50% of the variations we have), shouldnt they still lower the overall accuracy?"
"we havenm't performed a separate experiment only doing constant changes, but we could do that quickly and get the results"
"especially for constant changes, we don't expect models to actually be able to reason, so the model *should* do much worse on the variations than the originals"
"where we alter the variable names and constant values and change the solution accordingly"
"it's something like this"
""
"especially big models like llama and gpt which use the entire internet"
"our hypothesis right now is: The Putnam is openly available on the internet, so it would likely have been included in the training data of LLMs"
"thanks so much for your time again!"
"if the models were contaminated, they should theoretically get higher on original *always*, right? Our results don't really make any sense, then, as they suggest that the models can actually reason..."
"Also, another question: We're seeing somewhat inconsistent differences between the accuracies on our variation problems and the original problems; sometimes the variations will get higher accuracy and sometimes the originals get higher"
"Yes, that's what we thought as well \ud83d\ude42"
"for our model evaluations, would it be better for us to just run the evaluations directly using VLLM and our own evaluation functions? Or should we use an existing LLM evaluation tool like LM-Harness from EleutherAI?"
"Hey Prof. Koyejo, I had another quick question"
"thank you so much for your time!"
"yes, I think that averaging at the problem level is what makes sense for us"
"as in, we would include both averages?"
"sorry, what do you mean by hierarchical average?"
"however, if you consider **each problem** as a separate iid bernoulli random variable, each accuracy is an average of n=50, so we would have to divide by sqrt(50)"
"which makes the confidence intervals very large"
"That's the problem: We technically average over the 5 accuracies from the 5 runs"
"Thanks so much!"
"We were debating: For confidence intervals, should we be dividing by sqrt(5) or sqrt(50) or sqrt(250)? That would affect our confidence intervals greatly."
"Now, to try to distinguish between original and variation, we took the mean of the variations and original runs and are trying to compute their confidence intervals to see if they overlap. For the confidence intervals, we decided to divide the standard deviation by sqrt(5), since we had 5 runs. We got the following graph with massive confidence intervals"
"Basically:\n\nFor our PUTNAM variations dataset, we have functional variations of 50 different questions. Of these 50 variations, we sampled 5 questions each to get a dataset of 250 questions. We evaled this dataset of 250 *five times* on different models and obtained the accuracies of each run. We also ran the original 50 questions 5 times and obtained the accuracies of each run"

We did see the email, and we\u2019re currently discussing how to respond as a team on our leadership group chat.\n> \n> I\u2019ll answer the ones I can on my own right now: I MIGHT be able to make it on the 25th. As of right now, my PSEO Spring Schedule has a tentative class on that day. However, I\u2019m thinking about choosing between this class and an earlier one, and there\u2019s a chance that I\u2019ll drop it beforehand.\n> \n> I could probably write one or two science bowl packets?? I don\u2019t have much experience with my non-major fields, and since I didn\u2019t play science bowl in MS, I don\u2019t really know how to gauge difficulty. I\u2019ll talk more with Matthew and Aneesh and other members about this and see if we can create good questions. We\u2019ll also check other online databases to see if there are any packets we can use.\n> \n> Finally, I can send out word right now regarding mentors/volunteers.\n> \n> Sorry, again, for the late response! We\u2019ll be sure to get back to you with a more complete response as soon as possible."

"> Aneesh, Eric, and Matthew,\n> \n> Ms. Laugen sent me the email below.\u00a0 I think the MS coaches are not expecting a multi-Zoom tournament,\u00a0which is what I thought you had in mind.\u00a0 I also don't know that\u00a0a multi-day experience is compatible with what they offer their\u00a0kids.\u00a0 It might make more sense to have a 1 afternoon and into the evening event where the middle schools compete against each other.\u00a0 If you want to try a multi-day thing, we might need to depart from normal practice days and not expect MS coaches to be present. I'd need the approval of the MS coaches to do this.\n> \n> Let's share the Science Bowl flyer with our club at some point.\u00a0 Neither Dylan Morin (WMS) nor Emma Johnson (EMS) expressed interest in volunteers, but I imagine that's because they don't know how volunteers could be useful to them.\u00a0 I think if there were kids who wanted to help out, they could contact those coaches directly to ask.\n> \n> We did an\u00a0inter-school tournament 2 years ago when we were virtual. It worked out well. We were not able to get one together last year, I believe because\u00a0it was hard for everyone to be available in person on the same days. A Zoom competition could work this year if we can't find a common day. I am attaching the schedule that I created for Science Bowl practices at CMS this year.\u00a0 At the end of the 7th/8th grade session, the teams will be chosen and will continue to practice until the Regional Competition on 2/11! We will be meeting on Wednesdays, and I have a separate session\u00a0for 6th grade as an introduction.\n> \n> A few high schoolers have already reached out to me regarding assisting with practices. Please share the schedule with others, I would be happy to have their help!"

"Let's talk at 3:30"
"This thing can work"
"I will try to create time"
"I'm spending too much time on Euro"
"Rn It's just my problem"
"No, we can make time to do this"
"Bruh I have 4 AP classes"
"and shit"
"and then notes"
"Euro in my school has like 10 pages of reading every night"
"sorry I've been absorbed with school work"
"yea def"
"We need to get this ball rolling"
"smh"
"no responses yet"
"Additionally, how's the recruiting going??"
"Try to get ur guys's parents to join the non-profit board"
"I don't think we need a meeting right now"
"OK"
"Euro Homework hits hard tho"
"yea same"
"And two of ur guys\u2019s parents"
"So my mom"
"Guys for the nonprofit organization, we need three adults"
"pretests show what they need work on"
"Plus, yea"
"The same test for everyone"
"If we want to expand, we need a concrete measurement of improvement"
"The problem I have with the \"Ask for grades\" system is just that the grading is extremely varied across schools"
"Or for math, we can tell them that the questions are from books"
"like the SAT passages"
"We can use a third party test, too"
"Sure"
"but They're all doable"
"For others, those are a lil bit trickier"
"For Reading, we can use two similar-leveled SAT passages"
"for math"
"from the UMTYMP textbooks"
"Quang and I can just copy some problems"
"Oh, pretests aren't hard"
"\"How strict was the gradign?\""
"\"What kind of tests did the teachers make?\""
"\"What grading did the teachers do?\""
"The school will be skeptical"
"If we just say \"Yo, this student went from a B to an A because of our course\""
"if we want to advertise to a school"
"So like"
"We need absolute measurement"
"Just solely because schools have such varied grading methods"
"Except, unlike sports, which only use time, academics are a lot harder to measure"
"say 30 seconds"
"And u improve"
"your coach times you again"
"Then, when you're finished training"
"time urself at the start"
"you run 100 meeters"
"You join a sports team"
"it's like this:"
"Pretest is just to measure their skill at the beginning"
"may not be that much in another"
"I'm saying that a lot of improvement in one school"
"we need a concrete way to measure that"
"The question is How much improvement"
"An A in St. Paul school district may equate a B+ in Wayzata"
"For example"
"different schools different grading"
"School grades are too variable"
"We need strong evidence that we can do what we claim"
"If we're gonna wanna advertise to low-income schools and become big"
"Welll, not that kind of pretest"
"Not enough to show improvement"
"It's not reliable"
"Schools grade differently"
"there will be a lot of variation"
"If we measure it purely by their school grades"
"It's so that we can measure improvement using a concrete method"
"See if u can use some science bowl/quizz bowl questiosn"
"no"
"On science?"
"just like 10 questions"
"it doesnt have to be long, either"
"add some 5th-10th grade"
"so like"
"that way, we can measure improvement"
"add both easy and hard questions"
"I alr basically have the math pretest done"
"Forgot to mention science"
"Sure*"
"Sue"
"I have a few original SAT packets"
"I think some old SAT questions can work"
"We'll also need an english pretest"

"I saw exactly 1.09441 square inches of a girl's shoulder today.\n\nI immediately fell to my knees, as the rush of dopamine caused by the impending earth-shattering orgasm started making me moan loud enough to deafen everyone in the immediate vicinity. What followed was a torrential downpour of every single sperm cell I ever have or ever will produce, shot out so hard that my dick was ripped apart by my \u00fcbernut accelerating to 5% the speed of light by the time it left my urethra. It vaporized the girl as it punched right through her, barely slowed, before cutting through a structural support beam in the school as if it were a nuclear-powered angle grinder. The sheer weight of this historical nut, combined with the total destruction of everything in its path, caused the school to collapse, and every female in the state of Illinois to fall pregnant with my children. When the final death toll was tallied, there were 146 deaths, 458 injuries, and over 4 million pregnancies. As I lay dying under the rubble of my high school, I rest easy, knowing every one of my sons will repeat my glorious actions. Goodbye."

"P(X < x, Y < y) = P(X' < x, Y' < y) = P(X' < x) P(Y' < y) = P(X < x) P (Y < y)"

"it's easy proof"
"bruh wait"
"oh wait"
"so that's necessarily the same density as (X', Y'), so the two cannot possibly be independent"
"like if u let X = Y, you'd end up with a density that's only nonzero on a single line"
"then like somehow the dimensionality of (X', Y') would also need to be smaller than 2 right?"
"and X and Y are correlated"
"but if (X', Y') need to be identical in law to (X, Y)"
"this kills the problem"
"but like"
"yeah..."
"ooh wait but ig if u take the limit as y -> infinity, you can get P(X < x) = P(X' < x) from P(X < x, Y < y) = P(X' < x, Y' < y)"
"P(X < x, Y < y) = P(X' < x, Y' < y) ==> P(X < x) = P(X' < x) and P(Y < y) and P(Y' < y)"
"it's like you're saying"
"intuitively it should"
"idk if it does or not"
"i think this is a stronger statement"
"no, as in (X,Y) and (X', Y') have the same law"
"that's kind of the roadblock u need to solve this"
"let's say u have two random vectors (X, Y) and (X', Y') with the same laws. If you know X' and Y' are independent, can you say X and Y are independent?"

"i was playing this on repeat"
"in covid summer"
"\ud83d\ude04"
"lets lsiten again"
"that rap part"
"i popped off"
"when rich brian's part came on in this song"
"yesterday on the car"
"maybe youll associate this song with this summer"
"hmm i guess thats true lol"
"only \"p good\" \ud83d\ude14"
"are immaculate"
"the vibes in this song"
"???"
"yep"
"apparently sumac in person this year was so fun"
"its fitting"
"yeah"
"guess what song's in this video \ud83d\ude04"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2EiO_uPLxA&t=15s&ab_channel=EmilyJin"
"august."
"and nostalgic at the end"
"this song is hype at the beginning of summer"
"I KNOW"
"and it will bring out nostalgia in u that u never knew existed"
"it is very good"
"we need to listen to it more then"
"wait whens the last time u listened to midsummer"
"let me mix in some good shit"
"this is crying music"
"u want sleeping music??"
"HAHAHA"
"whyy"
"this music"
"so sad"
"cual tipo de musica"
"music."
"okok anyways"
"its so embarassing"
"\ud83d\ude2d thats why u gotta mute"
"yeah HAHA"
"and two of my friends kept texting me on discord and the pings were so loud \ud83d\ude2d"
"last year i gave a testimony"
"just have it on in the back while u do other stuff haha"
"but u prolly dont need to like do too much"
"well i think u should show face"
"or photos of game night ig"
"HAHA class photos?"
"basically they present a bunch of photos from the 3 weeks and student testimonies and stuff like that"
"it's kinda useless"
"\ud83d\ude2d"
"are u gonna have one last game night today"
"or something"
"apparently gauss or whatever proved it wth group theory"
"that project took 3 ppl in my year HAHA"
"holy shit"
"a single dude??"
"those were the presentations i remember from my year lol"
"or like hamming codes"
"or cryptography"
"did someone present on rubiks cube too"
"HAHA thats what i was thinking"
"the rubiks cube thing got a little dull after a while lol"
"damnn i wish i did something like that"
"that sounds interesting"
"ooh music theory and group stuff?"
"presentation go"
"LMAO howd ur uh"
"are u done with sumac now"
"haelo"
"friday?"
"tmrw's my duluth trip hehe"
"i cant music tmrw tho"
"bye bye"
"haha ok!"
"acne cleanser is prolly  enough HAHA"
"but for teens"
"i saw retinol on youtube skin care videos \ud83d\ude2d"
"yeahh that's prolly the purpose"
"ik ppl who have retinol and stuff like that"
"and lotion"
"thats it"
"i use a salicylic acid thing"
"LMAO so fancy"
"spill"
"do u have a skincare routine"
"HAHA it's different than the lotion i usually use"
"skincare \ud83d\udc85"
"with spf 30"
"i got a morning facial cream from walgreens like 3 days ago"
"LMFAO were u gonna say that"
"WAIT"
"to not get wrinkled??"
"LMFAO apparently u have to wear sunscreen every dya??"
"and still getting on to do music seshes HAHA"
"everyone's wrinkled n shi"
"imagine in like 20 years"
"cuz they attract users to discord"
"they prolly get some funding from discord to do that right"
"probably HAHA"
"this bot will give me an aneurysm someday"
"this fucking bot"
"fake fan"
"thought u would like repeat tswift tho"
"cuz the bot broke and i had to requeue the playlist \ud83d\ude2d"
"but not on email"
"i think i kinda do during our meetings"
"LMAO not really??"
"i was going to ask my mentor but he's in france on vacation rn \ud83d\ude26"
"im not even sure it's possible to make this function linear lol"
"haha ok good!"
"lmme lemme finish this work first and then i'll look at the problem"
"hold on im multitasking rn HAHA"
"wait im also kinda confused"
"so u know that a' is not in Z_p"
"because f is irreducible"
"LMAO a ton of it's just formalities for rigorousness"
"i think"
"so in that sense, a' generates F'"
"u can similarly prove that Z_p(a') = Z_p/<f(x)> = F'"
"and consider the field Z_p(a')"
"if u let a' be the root of f(x) in F'"
"basically"
"which is an easy isomorphism"
"that way u can prove that u can generate F' the same way u generated F"
"so basically u want to show that the root of f(x) in F' has mult order p^k-1?"
"ohh are u saying"
"we're not modding F' out by <f(x)>"
"wait im confused HAHA wdym"
"mhmm"
"which u already did with f(x) | h(x)"
"and u prove that the same f has a root in F'"
"you assume it is the same f"
"i think they intend for it to be the same f"
"with part c u show that F' = Z_p[x]/<f(x)>"
"well with part b u showed that F = Z_p[x]/<f(x)> right"
"idt u need to show that a' = a at all"
"ok so which part of the proof of 12.8 do u need this for"
"f is a valid polynomial in F' too right"
"where is f' coming from"
"okok where is f'"
"u need to show that there exists an isomorphism phi: F --> F' such that phi(a) = a'"
"u dont need to show that a = a'"
"see why fields are nice"
"yes."
"meaning..."
"meaning it can be factored in F'"
"ur guaranteed that h(x) has a root  at every element of F'"
"but just use the fact that f|h"
"ig u have to prove that it has a root in F'"
"which means it's a valid polynomial when applied to elements of F'"
"f has coefficients in Z_p"
"if F' is another random field of order p^k, the same holds"
"well F was just a random field of order p^k"
"yeah u proved it in part b HAHA"
"ur trying to prove that F is isomorphic to Z_p[x]/<f(x)>?"
"ohh"
"whats the problem"
"because F is isomorphic to Z_p[x]/<f(x)>"
"yeah LMAO"
"cuz the descent thing went extreme and the probability of connection ended up being 100% HAHA"
"the curves in that graph are too straight"
"i just want it to be linear"
"doesnt have to be (6,1000)"
"apparently the chip bot team is working on a fix for this issue"
"yeah fuckin hell"
"but the timesteps are constant"
"hmm i guess one variable could be time"
"not calculating the cost function"
"the majority of the time will be spent conducting the simulation for each gradient step"
"but i think like"
"well yes"
"yess"
"which are different from the exponential curves predicted in disease dynamics theory"
"for the covid pandemic a ton of countries saw lienar infection curves"
"so ok"
"nono i want to mimic linearity"
"irl apparently countries have linear infection curves"
"but these are infection  curves on a simulated pandemic"
"it's kinda hard to explain"
"which might work?"
"theres something in there about the pearson correlation coefficient tho"
"idk how to fit a function to a set of pts in python tho :(("
"hmmm"
"but rn im taking the avg of the absolute vals of the second derivatives"
"not continuous"
"it's a discrete function"
"yea"
"the green one \ud83d\ude2d"
""
"lemme show u"
"and im doing gradient descent but my linearity function has a rly weird local minimum"
"i have this function and i want to find parameters to the function to make it more linear"
"but like"
"LMAO idk if it's stats related"
"like how close it is to a straight line"
"how do u quantify the linearity of a function"
"wait michelle i have a question"
"so preserves addition and multiplication"
"of the fields"
"it's a bijective ring homomorphism"
"u need to prove it HAHA"
"yeah it does, but that's not a very trivial fact"
"and since isomorphism is an equivalence relation, u can prove that F' is isomorphic to F"
"cuz u prove that F is isomorphic to Z_p/<f(x)>"
"that's how the standard proof goes"
"usually it's part a > b > d"
"focus!"
"mm"
"overdose"
"cuz *O*ne *D*irection"
"before my friends told me that od means something else \ud83d\ude02"
"i used to call it od"
"bot finally works tho!"
"HAHA smh"
"oh no were u camera off sleeping on zoom today"
"LMFAO"
"where she lets u present ur solution at the beginning of class"
"does tina still do that thing"
"\ud83d\ude2d"
"i might be tripping"
"right?"
"u alr know that f(x) | h(x) in Z_p[x]"
"so like every element x of F' must also satisfy x^(p^k) - x = 0"
"i forgot what notation they used"
"the other field"
"and h(x) a valid polynomial in F' right"
"u know that f|h"
"ahh thats so tragic"
"wait but i thought u had c and d \ud83d\ude2d"
"LMFAO"
"did anyone else solve it"
"so fun"
"yeaa that problem right"
"the extension part is hard"
"cuz they have so many nice properties"
"no fields are actually rly nice"
"field extensions are so hard"
"LMAO i see that's relatable"
"oh wait is today about vector spaces"
"what happened HAHA"
"is it easier today"
"how's the pset going lol"
"bruh the fucking bot broke again"
"focus time."
"HAHA yepyep"
"dont u have a pset to do"
"ok anyway"
"so i'd bring up the partitions of poland and stuff"
"hes apparently a polish nationalist"
"its like i was snarky to try and provoke him to do funny things"
"HAHA no i loved him"
"and he called me a \"smartass\" for trying to stand up to him"
"yeaa i was super snarky in his class"
"that teacher was walking on the line between school appropriate adn not HAHA"
"or it leaves a red mark"
"but according to older kids it draws blood LMAO"
"idk i had him online so he didnt use it on us"
"he also has a finger guillotine in his classroom.."
"and my teacher claimed he saw a ton of versaille on the kid's search history"
"yeah LMAO we were on the french revolution unit and apparently theres a tv show called versaille which has a ton of sex in it"
"he singled out this single kid to bully about his search history"
"\ud83d\ude2d that sounds like my ap euro teacher"
"what fun things does ur teacher do HAHA"
"woah that's insane"
"\ud83e\udd29"
"woah wait is it an ap latin equivalent HAHA"
"cuz the teacher doesnt have super high standards for hs kids"
"LMAO i think generally higher level classes with hs kids are chill"
"if ur kinda forced to get an a+"
"haha ig ur school does have it harder tho"
"it's such disparity"
"but no weighted grade for a fucking topology course at the umn"
"so i get a weighted grade for doing jack shit in ap environmental science"
"our school doesnt weigh college classes"
"yk whats stupid"
"yeaa it does"
"some of our classes dont even have a+ as a grade option HAHA"
"oh ig u dont have to work as hard"
"how"
"lucky!?"
"and they ONLY weight ap classes \ud83d\ude2d"
"a+ and a are weighted the same"
"at our school"
"WHAT"
"wait do u guys get gpa boost for a+"
"wish i had that talent"
"u dont have to!"
"well if ur like insane at english"
"or like \"why is this argument potent\""
"it was more like \"what rhetorical device did this author employ\""
"LMAO ok ours wasnt like plot specific either"
"it's so stressful cuz the final's worth a lot of pts"
"literally everything"
"yes."
"\"There may not be a reason to make it easier for students. They are, after all, complete strangers to you. They probably will be gone in a few months, after which you won\u2019t have to see their worried faces or hear about their immense stress load or watch their hopes and dreams crumble.\""
"like our final exam was about everything we read in teh class"
"a lot of the summative assignments were about the formative work"
"LMFAO well not really"
"so u couldnt cushion ur grade with homework pts"
"our ap lang class was 100% summative grades"
"LMAO ur lucky that homework assignments even count"
"what's so hard about it"
"LMFAO ofc it's an english class too"
"yea.."
"not counting a-'s tho"
"who ended term 1 with an a"
"there were only like 4 students in the class of 30"
"i might've been a little emotional while i wrote this"
"its so nice right"
"yea thats my school account HAHA"
"its from lemony snicket's on occupy wall street"
"complaining about how hard the class is"
"i made a parody of an article we read in the class"

"yayy"
"so.."
"and we knew that other ppl werent gonna do very well"
"well this was one of the class grade assignments i told u about"
"and we still got an a- on the essay \ud83d\ude2d"
"we had a group project that me and this one other kid stayed up until like 3am grinding"
"last year for ap lang"
"HAHA"
"way less productive"
"but less productive"
"late night project grinds are better with other ppl"
"LMFAO okok"
"omg were u on a late night zoom call yesterday \ud83d\ude02"
"we have to wait a bit ig"
"yea.."
"oh LMAO does tina give u time in class to work"
"ohh hows that going"
"did u stay up late yesterday"
"HAHA isok it happens"
"halo"
"tmrw!?"
"bye bye"
"i gotta go"
"okok theyre here"
""
"or the taylor swift cap HAHA"
"vinyls and stuff"
"what about like"
"fake fan"
"WHAT"
"LMFAO u answered before i even finished the q"
"oh yeah mb forgot who im asking \ud83d\udc80"
"just to wear different merch"
"would u go to a tswift concert twice"
"just for the outfits??"
"LMFAO that seems so excessive"
"and it turns out they were wearing all pink too HAHA"
"they said \"oppenheimer\" but after the guy left they all took off their hoodies"
"and they clowned him for watchign barbie and he asked htem \"oh what movie are u guys here to watch\""
"and his friends came all dressed with hoodies"
"this one guy and his gf went to watch barbie and he was dresed in pink"
"the tiktok went like"
"it's not \"manly\"??"
"but theyre actually seeing barbie LMAO"
"like a group of guys pretending theyre going to see oppenheimer"

"yes"
"barbie was one of the movies that wasn't tho!!"

"idk why"
"get on my nerves"
"the chords"
"hodl on"

"they said \"the men in this family\" LMFAO"
"yeah that's inevitable"
"the plot line was interesting tho"
"idt the science of the movie was sciencing very well"
"HAHA maybe it is"
"do u see what i mean"
"to stop an event that didnt happen"
"then ur future self wouldn't have had to go back in time"
"if u successfully stop ur past self from time traveling"
"hmm but"
"it's the grandfather paradox right"
"then ur future self doesnt need to go back in the first place"
"but if ur past self doesnt time travel"
"so like stop ur past self from time traveling HAHA"
"wait what"
"what do u think"
"a beautiful mind"
"so true"
"HAHAHA"
"imitation game"
"about time!!"
"hmm"
"pirate a movie"
"u should"
"smh giving up"
"LMFAO"
"wait ur not on the pset anymore??"
"u have to do a little bit more manipulation"
"is not directly from the fact that hte integers are a euclidean domain"
"btw the gaussain integer problem"

"no idea"
"yes."

"OK"
"my friends wanna get boba again so i gotta go in like 30 min LMAO"
"ok haha lmk when ur done"
"to listen to the video"
"break"
"wait"
"the bot broke"
"\ud83d\ude02"
"have u done 12.9 yet"
"from that fucking textbook"
"hehe i get to apply my knowledge"
"i htink this is exactly how u prove it"
"wait this means that F DOES have all the roots of f(x)"
"and u can use the fact that f | h"
"cuz h(x) has all roots of F' too"
"and then the rest is straightforward i think"
"ITS SO OBVIOUS"
"YES"
"<@440556004154015746>"
"which is a cont"
"and since gcd(f,h) is in Z_p[x] and it's not equal to f, its degree must be less than f"
"gcd(f,h) must still have a as a root"
"if f(x) does not divide h(x), then find gcd(f,h)"
"A IS A ROOT OF H(X"
"IM SO STUPID"
"OH FUCKING HELL"
"cuz they arent necessarily"
"ohh thats why i cant prove that all roots of f are in F"
"so split up the real and imag components"
"but it looks like u can derive gaussian integer euclideanness from integer euclideanness"
"i havent finished it"
"(a+bi) = q (c+di) + r"
"basically"
"it looks like it"
"my brain is also kind of fried"
"UGH"
"what have u guys learned so far"
"agh idk how ur supposed to do it with sumac stuff"
"which is a contradiciton"
"and if this is true than u can use the fact that F has characteristic p to show that f is not irreducible"
"f(x) only has multiple 0s iff it's of the form g(x^p) where g(x) is in Z_p[x]"
"so theres this one theorem"
"so every irreducible in it has no multiple 0s"
"ok F is a finite field"
"oh wait fuck im stupid..."
"we just need to show that u can fully factor f in F"
"ok so the characteristic of F is p"
"i love closer"
"hehe closer"
"im forgetting"
"theres a really good way to show this"
"they should all be in F"
"which must be roots of h and we're done"
"if all roots have multiplicity 1, we know that they are k distinct elements of F"
"but if we can show that a has multiplicity 1, we can show all roots have multiplicity 1"
"im thinking about induction"
"we know one of them is a"
"something somethign a is algebraic over Z_p"
"but apparently i didnt fully absorb it"
"i read this shit like 2 days ago tho"
"i took error codes and cryptography \ud83d\ude2d"
"wait hold on hold on"
"ok"
"yes"
"i.e the vector field of {1,a, ..., a^k-1} over Z_p"
"F is isomorphic to Z_P (a)"
"but"
"shit if u guys didnt learn this in class idk if u can use it"
"the roots of f have to be in F"
"yes"
"let me cook"
"wait wait wait"
"u dont need to"
"yes"
"because h(x) is all of the roots (x-a) multiplied together"
"all u need to do is show there are no multiple roots in f"
"fuck im stupid"
"oh wait"
"wait why is that"
"is what because of that"
"hmmm"
"HAHA"
"right"
"so fun"
"it's fun tho!!"

"ahh right"

"oh maybe ur right"
"wait wdym"
"hmm true"
"well they obv changed the worksheet"
"i feel so old"
"they changd the curriculum"
"HAHA"
"than this stuff"
"i thought vector spaces were covered way earlier"
"what??"
"leme think"
"i think that's a proof by cont as well"

"yea it looked doable"
"im almost done with it"

"Background knowledge about machine learning (ML) is needed to understand the application of ML into classifying BSMs.\n\nML is inspired by the human ability to take in information and make decisions or predictions based on that information. For instance, a doctor can look at a patient's symptoms and make a diagnosis as to what disease that patient may have.\n\nTo make these decisions, ML first needs to train. It does so by looking at a large set of examples called the \\textit{training set} and trying to recognize helpful patterns or clues in this training set. Each example in this training set has two parts: a set of \\textit{features} containing information about the example and a \\textit{label} attached to those features. With this terminology, the ultimate goal of any ML algorithm is, given an input of a set of \\textit{features}, correctly output a prediction of the correct \\textit{label} to those features. For instance, if we created an ML algorithm to diagnose diseases, our algorithm would train by looking at a large set of patient examples, where each patient's symptoms are the \\textit{features}, and their diagnosed disease is given as the \\textit{label}. Then, after training, we want this algorithm to be able to take in a new set of symptoms and correctly decide which disease is attributable to those symptoms.\n\nAn ML algorithm is tested and verified by using a large dataset. A large chunk of this dataset is cut off to use as the training set. The remaining data is used to test and verify how accurate the algorithm is. The percentage of the dataset cut off to use as training data is called the \\textit{training percentage}. The splitting of the dataset is called the \\textit{train/test split}."

"Well, to answer your question:\n\nWhen I was a kid, maybe 6 or 7, I threw up in my aquarium. I had to puke, and for some reason, didn\u2019t want to run to the bathroom and I didn\u2019t want to just puke on my floor. So the fish tank was right there. And I guess it was a bunch of water, so I threw up into it. And the fishes swam around excitedly for a moment and then died. I scooped them out and flushed them and used the net to get out my vomit chunks. I told my dad they just died and he of course got all concerned and started talking about distilled water and minerals and testing pH and everything. And I guess I was scared to say anything because I knew my mom would freak out if she knew I threw up. Like, I was just a kid and didn\u2019t want to have to go to the doctor and he jabbed with needles and have my uvula clamped. So I just leaned into the lie and my dad and I completely redid the fish tank.\n\nI just feel bad that those little tetras\u2019 last breaths were the burning sting of some ape\u2019s stomach acid."

"also, our variations would be really hard to transition over"
"this could work, but it would involve rerunning **all** of our previous evals and completely overhauling our dataset"
"however, it does present a potential future problem: if we get sued for a paper we published many years ago, it won't be a good look for any of our careers"
"it seems that the field is, as a whole, more concerned with progress than these copyright issues, so past papers with these same issues have gotten through"
"I see. Thank you for the clarification \ud83d\ude42"
"I don't know if this is possible; they are a very disconnected company with a \"don't call us, we'll call you\" mentality"
"yes, I did\u2013\u2013it led to the issues I sent"
"Emily got the LM-Harness stuff functional, but I'm still having some troubles getting your code to work"
"I'm a little bit confused"
"Also <@489839779261841409>, is your eval code connected to the LM-Harness evals?"
"i don\u2019t know if there is a way to contact the recruiter, but i\u2019ll let you know if i do find anything"
"yes, this is clear."
"Hi Brando,\n\nAgain, I sincerely apologize for contacting Prof. Koyejo like this. I was never intending to disrespect you in any way whatsoever. **I respect, have respected, and will respect your leadership and status as a researcher.**\n\nI\u2019m still very new to doing professional research, so I don\u2019t have much experience when it comes to things like contacting a professor. This is a learning opportunity, and I\u2019ve taken away a valuable lesson so, in the future, I\u2019ll be much more aware of everything like this. \n\nI contacted Sanmi only because I was trying to move as quickly as possible on all fronts of our project; I was really stressing about the ICLR abstract and submission deadline in a month\u2019s time. That is all. I wasn\u2019t intending to bypass your involvement, but only to get things done quickly and report back to you. \n\nTo be clear: **I never asked Sanmi to do anything at all without your expressed approval**; I was only asking him for his opinion on we should do in this situation. I realize that this was out of line, and I will reflect on this and do better in the future.\n\nI\u2019m super grateful for everything you\u2019ve done for me and for the project. Again, I have **always** respected your leadership and trajectory as a researcher, and I\u2019m really sorry that I messed up this time. Thank you for all of your patience with my learning to be a better researcher."
"again, i\u2019m really sorry for all of this! i wasn\u2019t aware of these problems"
"I'm so sorry! I wasn't aware of the implications of my contact with Prof. Koyejo. I think I was carried away in trying to maximize velocity and getting our paper finished ASAP. I'll be much more self aware of inappropriate contact like this in the future.\n\nI never stated anything about your position on the issue (so this does not implicate anything about you); I simply painted the objective picture of the copyright issue we currently face so that Prof. Koyejo can provide an accurate opinion.\n\nIn the future, I'll be much more careful about reaching out to Prof. Koyejo. \n\nThanks so much for all your help this summer."
"Let me message the recruiter; Apple doesn't actually have a contact email for internship recruiting"
"additionally, it's suboptimal if we release our dataset paper without our data, as our results would not be replicable and we lose a huge part of our contribution"
"and recommend better solutions to this problem"
"I asked Prof. Koyejo about potential action plans so that emily and I could be more informed on the situation"
"I am trying to be as quick as we can, given that we have a little over a month to figure everything out and write the paper"
"for the rec letter, do you know anyone at Apple who you could talk to?"
"also, Brando, sanmi said that you two have already tried emailing Hendrycks?"
"I may need you to help me convince him to send it hahaha"
"so I've asked him to make it specific to Apple"
"sanmi says he may be uncomfortable sending it to me"
"very good question haha"
"and it's a pretty far away place in Europe"
"but it might not be safe for her to go, as she's going alone as a girl"
"she probably wants to go"
"yeah i'll ask her"

"Hey Brando! I don't think I can register for you for AITP\u2013\u2013you should log onto your easychair account and see the link"
"where the original accuracies are almost always (except in the case of Llama-8B for some reason) higher"
"TLDR: we've made a ton of new graphs! The ones where we divide by sqrt(50) show a statistically significant difference between original and variation"

"and the variation accuracies are a lot lower"
"also, based on what we said in the discord channel, we ran it with a one-sample of the 50 variations"

"and that process will take a bit"
"cuz they don't pass all of kai's tests"
"i don't know about soon... the variations are technically all ready, but they have some small bugs that we're gonna have to comb through and squash"
"i think i could do it before wednesday"
"a priori, it doesn't seem to take too long"
"i thought you meant we should parse out what were good questions"
"that would be one click"
"i think kai has some script written to use the decorators"
"hmm let me check actually"
"after 1:30, were free to do all of this"
"could we do thursday?"
"ahhh we have two midterms tuesday and thursday"
"it would be rly sick if this were applicable in math research"
"which is beyond both textbooks and competitions"
"i think the hopes of this project is to get to the boundaries of what's actually possible with an ai mathematician"
"yeah definitely"
"so i transitioned from competition to research"
"and most of all, competition problems were already solved while research problems were open mysteries"
"whereas competition problems were just using the same mathematical concepts in different convoluted ways, research problems were more difficult and had a wide variety of different approaches"
"but i saw at sumac that research math problems and deeper problems were much more beautiful than competition problems"
"during that time i was in my full competition swing"
"i got into the stanford university math camp in 10th grade summer"
"I was reminded of this during one of my activities this weekend\u2013\u2013I \"retired\" from competition math a while ago"
"translating problems is a lot different than actually *doing* them in competition"
"HAHA i guess?"
"awesome, i'll proceed with that in mind"
"emily and bruno say that we want variable AND constant stuff, but it's not always possible to do both"
"also, brando"
"idt he will talk about the information with other ppl"
"i'll email him with that information"
"yes, i agree"
"like should I talk about why we're making variations?"
"also, if im asking profs to recruit for the project, how much of what we're doing should I reveal?"
"i'll let u know once he does"
"okay he hasnt made an account yet HAHA"
"also, brando, could you share the putnam github with Bruno so he can use the json files to do some variations?"
"awesome \ud83d\ude42 thanks"
""
""
"okay he sent them"
"okay got it"
"i told him to prep a resume"
"should we bring bruno today?"
"brando"
"yess that makes sense"
"though I've scoured through over 10 years of problems already haha"
"i'll endeavor to find as many good ones as I can, then"
"very smart \ud83d\ude0a"
"i.e. we need enough complex changes to convince the public of the value of our research"
"and adding more complex changes for the ones that we deem appropriate"
"haha, so adding just variable name changes would suffice for most problems?"
"okay, let's discuss this more next meeting"
"so i don't know if our goal is feasible"
"it's actually quite difficult to find problems that have good variations"
"i don't know if aryan and emily mentioned this at the last meeting but"
"i'll try to get more of those out"
"okay, sounds good \ud83d\ude42"
"yes i\u2019ll do so after i take a closer look"
"or ig what kind of deliverables for next week"
"should we make more variations, then?"
"ohh i see"
"did you discuss this today at the meeting/"
"hey brando, what were the evaluation results like on the variation problems?"
"\"ring\" solves it"
"because the naturals are not a ring lol"
"but that's for integers, not natural numbers"
"yeah, praneeth solved it with one tactic"
"I'll ask this in the lean prover chat, but i was wondering if u had any intuition on thsi too"
""
"i've tried so many things but none of them work"
"how do you get Lean to know algebraic computations"
"brando \ud83d\ude2d"
"okay sounds good"
"what is that"
"also, the deliverables say that I should make sure I get \"pipeline fsi-tune\" from you?"
"thank you brando \ud83d\ude42"
"okay okay"
"how is emily going to do it, i thought you only had one poisition"
"oh wait, really?"
"wait brando, are both emily and I going to get summer projects?"
"i have a couple friends who have experience, i'll ask them"
"yes, i will"
"but i\u2019ll have a bigger support structure for 231 given that i have taken 131 and a lot of people i know are/have taken it"
"i\u2019m going to audit 224 at the beginning to see which one is right for me"
"yes it definitely will"
"i\u2019m rly excited about where this project is going"
"good, just wanted to confirm"
"i saw that the faculty rankings are due on 3/3 lol"
"hey brando, just to confirm: you\u2019re ranking me first for the CURIS summer project right?"
"i\u2019ll pay attention to privacy in the future"
"okay okay ty"
"and I can do casework on these three?"
"n is either 0, 1, or 2 mod 3"
"do you know how I can split up a modular arithmetic problem so I say:"
"Hey Brando, I'm trying to do formalization stuff"
"because no matter what happens we'll always have something to publish"
"i understand, this is kind of like risk minimization right"
"yes i will"
"yepp that sounds good"
"i\u2019ll work with emily on formalization then"
"yes, i think this is a good plan"
"cuz rn the materials rly interesting to me lol"
"hey brando, for the curis summer internship, it\u2019ll be a continuation of what we\u2019re doing right now right?"
"haha u mean my channel with u and emily right"
"okay okay"
"i should be done on time, but just in case"
"my moms here for parents weekend and wants to eat lunch haha"
"hey brando, i may be a little late for our meeting"
"it looks like moogle is a fictional creature in final fantasy iii lol"
"could you send me a link?"
"and it looks like begin/end doesn't work on our github repo"
"cuz i search up a lot of resources to try and learn, and some of them use \"begin/end\" and some of them use \"by\""
"also, it's really annoying that lean documentation is kinda inconsistent"
"so like the putnam folder"
"it seems to only work when i do it in one of the folders inside the MIL folder"
"oh nvm i got it working"
""
"i finally managed to get it working for a few basic things, but i cant import information about the natural numbers or primes"
"hey brando, why does my import statement not work for lean"
"we can talk this friday about it"
"the field of ml moves too quickly"
"oh, i see. that\u2019s very interesting haha"
"because papers are too slow"
"do you find twitter useful for research?"
"i remember your partner rylan had a project posting for hallucinations right?"
"this is an interesting twitter post"
"yea, i think that\u2019s a good idea"
"yes, though i try not to use it lol"
"that\u2019s really cool, thank you \ud83d\ude42"
"yep i saw that too"
"good night \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f"
"thanks so much Brando"
"yes, that sounds good. I have also emailed them to clarify"
"that should be fine"
"okay, so you just have one more researcher this summer \ud83d\ude42"
"is that what he means"
"okay, so you can still hire me, right?"
"it's very confusing i think"
"it guarantees i will get the highest ranked project"
"because the algorithm is this way"
"i will leave you as ranked first"
"if i recall, curis fellows are funded elsewhere"
"it is very confusing"
"but does that funding take up your lab funding?"
"do they guarantee funding for curis fellows?"
"oh.. wait what?"
"Evidence, in case admin messes up"
""
""
""
"i'm currently trying to submit a lot of applications to CURIS, so could we keep it brief?"
"sure, let's do it"
"I need to decide my project rankings today, and if there's something available for me, I'll rank you first and it's basically guaranteed that I'll get a spot with you"
"or if you could request for an independent project"
"do you know if there's a CURIS spot open for me on your project?"
"wait brando"
"but i also heard that sanmi can request for more positions for \u201cindependent projects\u201d"
"for the summer project, i think u rank applicants and they match ppl with the gale shapley matching  algorithm"
"okay brando i asked around, this is what i found"
"oh i see"
"it looks like you have two positions available, while rylan has one"
"Brando, is this Rylan's CURIS project?"
""
"i'd like to get involved in some machine learning stuff, but I don't know if she feels the same way"
"i would say tho, her interests and mine might differ"
"yes, sure"
"could you accept my friend req on my new account?"
"Also, Brando, I've decided to make a professional discord account so I can properly separate my personal and nonpersonal servers"
"i'll book friday for now"
"wait, it seems your calendly doesn't have time on the weekends"
"alright, i'll take a look"
"i'm trying to learn a bit of lean right now, i'll tell u my progress at our next meeting and we can discuss more"
"i see, this looks really cool"
"yes definitely, emily and I are friends"
"do you have time on Friday or on the weekend to meet?"
"okay, i will do that when i have more time after my midterm on thursday"
"okay, sounds good \ud83d\ude42"
"according to what the curis people say, the professor has the final say"
"ohh i see, i think it is sanmi's decision as to who he takes onto the project"
"I'll keep looking"
"Also, I've looked through a couple different papers regarding AI safety and mathematics, so far I haven't seen anything really mathematical"
"Let me know if you know anything about this"
"Hey brando, i'm looking into curis applications right now and am preparing my essays; if we could do summer curis without application that would be the most convenient, otherwise I will just apply to the different projects"
"so could we naturally continue our project into the summer?"
"hey brando, CURIS says that as long as sanmi is willing, I don't need to go through the regular CURIS application process to get summer position"
"that's alright, we can talk about this later"
"how's that?"
"wait maybe i can?"
"thats the only thing i cant change.."
"that's unlucky"
"HAHA ohh"
"is still hard?"
"do you mean learning lean?"
"okay, let me do that"
"right click my name and click \u201cchange friend nickname\u201d"
"all my friends would be confused if i changed my name"
"is there any way you can change my nickname on dms?"
"okay sounds good!"
"Hey Brando, I've asked the CURIS people regarding what the application process is like, and I've forwarded their reply to you"
"yeah, i think it'll be useful no matter what"
"and then the two are matched"
"where applicants rank their projects and the projects rank their applicants"
"from what i've heard, i remember there's a dual-ranking process"
"i see, thanks! Let's discuss this a little more in-depth during our meeting on Wednesday"
"haha i meant like what would the CURIS applicant selection process look like if I'm already on the project?"
"just so I'm understanding clearly, we'll work on the lean code individually, and you can go to the lean OHs if we need help?"
"how would my application work if I'm in the project during winter/spring quarters?"
"ooh cool this is like we're making a new field"
"but formalizing the mathematical statements about LLMs is definitely a good first step"
"ahh unfortunately i have a class on thursday from 1:30-2:50 and another one from 3-4:20"
"is this the project?"
""
"Hey Brando, did you put a project on the summer CURIS projects?"
"because that may lead to oversights"
"i think the mathematical definition would be a keystone for the entire endeavor, but we'd have to be really careful about what kind of definition we choose"
"how would we mathematically quanitify \"safety\" in this case?"
"hmm this does look very interesting"
"I'm also a little confused: Am I not doing the extracting data from textbooks LLMs project?"
"I was wondering about your new project"

"Hi I'm Eric, also 11th grader. Midwest is-best? (It really isn't. It's cold af here). I dislike geometry and combinatorics, but the magnitude of my dislike of geometry is larger than the magnitude of my dislike of combo. Other than math, I enjoy playing the piano, playing league of legends, and biking. I also LOVE eating pineapple pizza. I don't like La Croix sparkling water because it tastes bitter and disgusting. I also don't get why people hate raisin-oatmeal cookies\u2013I mean, sure, they're stigmatized because they're \"healthy,\" but they provide a nice, fiber-full snack that won't give you diabetes."

You really had to resort to my \"wardrobe\" to find an insult?\n3. I don't officially play a sport because of the time commitment. Turns out, there are more important things in the world than games. But I am not unathletic. I run, bike, and work out.\n4. My social life was far from peaking in middle school. My connections span the planet. I could draw a map of your connections on the back of my hand.\n5. The \"bitch at math camp\" is a future D1 tennis player and math genius. My standards are high. Your standards are not.\n6. To send the violin case was a joke. To retort in this way simply shows your imprudent unfamiliarity with social situations.\n7. I appreciate the compliment about how \"fucking smart\" people can be.\n8. Confidence is acquired. It requires hard work, dedication, and perseverance. So I guess you wouldn't know\n9. I never denied the fact that I am a nerd. I never denied the fact that I try to be funny. But at least I have some personality. You're just a piece of cardboard posing as a faux racist, homophobe, and occasional asshole online."

"ur actually good at singing them tho"
"HAHAHA are u j rly depressed or something"
"maybe ill go an octave lower"
"yes. so i have to improvise"

"LMFAO noo im bad at singing"

"have u seen those cat island videos"
"well it takes time!!"
"ahh i see i see"
"eveyr time i bike past a bunny on the side of the road, it always jumps in front of me"

"theyre secretly plotting their evil plans while they appear all cute and cuddly on the outside"
"that's how they trick u"
"lizards are very intersting creatures!!"
"iim p sure some of them canabilize their own babies so..."
"cuz the sphere is x^2+y^2+z^2=1"

"LMAO if we had detention for being late too many times i think my record would exceed urs"
"yeah HAHA i bet they will"
"read \"shitty first drafts\" by annie dillard it's a good short essay about writing"
"but apparently writing more then cutting down is a good writing strategy"
"oh wait yeahh i remember i was kinda pissed about that cuz before my year it was 250 words"
"but how do u think we could map the segments"
"the hint says to map the cuts to the sphere tho"
"depressing"
"do u have detention on the first day of school then"
"LMAOO they were like \u201cah not again\u201d"

"the high notes were so hard"
"but my singing isnt?? <:upsidedown_cry:796852636318040075>"

"that's the function i'm imagining"
"ok imagine that [0,2pi] determines the point on the equator that ur directly above/below and [0,pi] determines the angle you have from the north pole"
"no like ok if ur doing [0,2pi] and [0,pi], all of the (x,0) are mapped to the exact same point"

"aww that's too bad"
"and wolves"
"we have foxes here tho"
"yeah they would all freeze to death"
"HAHAHA that seems like a traumatic memory for you"
"because multiple cuts are mapped to the same point"
"and my original one wasnt continuous"
"hmmm ok but first we need to find an actual continuous map"
"there  def is one"
"or i didnt find a continous mapping"
"there's no continuous mapping then ugh"
"OH FUCK ur right im stupid"
"that's so funny"
"LMFAO wait that's a thing?? ur in debt for detention hours?"
"WHAT??? THREE??? u might as well have gone to prison"
"arent they usually optional"
"oh yeah i remember for the umn i j wrote some random bull shit down and sent it in"
"look at primes success rate"
"no literally that's pretty  close HAHA"
"yeah HAHA u cant program social interactions ig"
"theyre kinda annoying tho"
"u should play with the cats"
"cats!!"
"we dont have any lizards here idt haha"
"oh that's rly cool"
"what if one of the cuts is on teh  very edge and u cant add more of the color without changing the amount of the other color"
"it's possible to shift by the same fraction and have the other color remain the same"
"hmm how do u know if like"
"let me see if that could actually work"
"ohhh that's an interesting idea"
"it doesnt matter if tow cuts are mapped to the same point, as long as the map is continuous"
"but u mirror it across the middle"
"we're assuming radius is always positive here"
"it covers half the sphere"
"i mean u only have  like 2 detentions??"
"i have the sneaking suspicion that u arent tho"
"HAHAHA if ur one of those ppl that would be so unlucky"
"like u know ur gonna get into mit but in that 0.001% chance that u dont u have to apply to so many other schools"
"haha it's always a trade off"
"yeah... it's prolly cuz they've dealt with some interesting students HAHA"
"ppl say my neighborhood has coyotes too but ive never seen one"
"but we dont feed them anything"
"there are a ton of bunnies around my house"
"oh really? what kinds of animals are around ur house"
"do u think we'd have to use induction \ud83d\ude2d"
"but like how do u prove that this modification process will end in finite time"
"and then ur second cut is mapped to [0,pi), so latitude-wise, where u want it"
"so like ur first cut is mapped to [0,2pi), so like longitude-wise where on the hemisphere u want it"
"they even wanted me to apply to asu"
"my parents made me write essays to cornell and uw madison and duke and columbia"
"HAHAHA this is rly relatable"
"it\u2019s basically \u201chow to socialize\u201d as a cs class"

"HAHAHA id expect harker students to make better decisions"
"i remember when i was rly young i set out a piece of cheese to see if there were mice in my house but it didn\u2019t get eaten"
"maybe actually"
"or like how u divide the intervals to make jewels"
"but how do u determine how much length makes a jewel"
"cuz there will be multiple cuts that are mapped to the same point at the top and bottom of the sphere"
"oh noo if u do spherical coordinates it won\u2019t be continuous"
"it wasn\u2019t actually rly stressful it was more j tiring"
"honestly i don\u2019t have many memories from the college app season"
"yeahh i guess ur right"
"do u really have to teach stanford cs students how to be emotionally intelligent"
"LMAO this class is j offensive to all cs majors"
"yeah she was commenting that \"no one expects ap students to do drugs\" HAHA"
"awww"
"and look at how happy he is with the cheese"
"this is a continuous function obviously, and by the hairy ball, it has to vanish somewhere, meaning that for some pair of cuts, Blue_A = Blue_B and Red_A = Red_B"
"then you let the function of each point on the sphere be (Blue_A - Blue_B, Red_A - Red_B)"
"then you mirror this across to the other half-sphere to get a continuous map on the entire sphere"
"then you map each pair of cuts of the necklace onto the half-sphere"
"basically u imagine the necklace is the interval [0,2pi] for the first cut and [0,pi] for the second cut"
"yeah and which color they are"
"you'll have enough time in late aug and sep oct nov to work on ur essays"
"imo u should enjoy ur summer more haha"

"LMAO superstar who managed to cross over from country"
"Taylor Swift is that rarest of pop phenomena: a superstar who managed to completely cross over from country to the mainstream. Others have performed similar moves -- notably, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson both became enduring pop culture icons based on their 1970s work -- but Swift shed her country roots like they were a second skin; it was a necessary molting to reveal she was perhaps the sharpest, savviest populist singer/songwriter of her generation, one who could harness the zeitgeist, make it personal and, just as impressively, perform the reverse."
