However, I happen to have a time conflict with the problem session time (Wednesday 6:05--8:25). I was wondering what the format of these problem sessions were like and if it would be feasible for me to take the course while not attending the problem sessions. Could there potentially be recordings of the meetings that I could look back at? Thank you so much!", "Attachments": ""},

I attended one of your lectures during an ARML practice and remember you mentioning that you had an intermediate course for Euler Circle.
