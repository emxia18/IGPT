Below are my answers to the five questions you've posted:\n1. Watermelons are better than mangoes\n2. I would prefer office hours on Tuesdays or Thursdays from 2-5\n3. I'm hoping to gain a more intuitive understanding of combinatorics and gain more rigor to back up the formulas and equations I've previously encountered.\n4. I've done a bit of competition math so I'm familiar with some of the common counting methods used in competition math.\n5. I'm currently a high school student (rising senior) but I'm thinking of potentially majoring in computer science next year.\n\nThank you so much!", "Attachments": ""}
