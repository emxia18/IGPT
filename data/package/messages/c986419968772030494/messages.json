It's basically saying if I have f(x) in Zp[x] and u is a unit in Zp[x]_f(x) then u^phi(f(x) = 1. (and a similar statement in Z[i]].)\n\nHowever in P1 I defined phi(f(x)) as the number of units in Zp[x]_f(x), which I believe would make this problem quite trivial (unless I am mistaken — I have a proof very similar to how we proved fermat's little theorem in mind). I was wondering if this type of definition for phi(f(x)) would cause me issues in the future. Thank you!", "Attachments": ""},

Is there another direction I could go down to prove this formula? thanks!", "Attachments": ""},
