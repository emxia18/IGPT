After a LOT of background reading and problem solving, we’ve grasped the concept of a monodromy and monodromy group. We’ve understood the Darboux equation\n\nIn particular, we’ve been able to transform the Darboux equation into an algebraic form:\nWe’ve successfully traversed important sections of Beukers’ 2007 paper about finding unitary monodromy groups. We’ve successfully emulated Beukers’ “gradient descent” method in the numerical data section of his paper to create an algorithm in Python that can accurately approximate the eigenvalues that yield unitary monodromy groups for any form of the Heun Equation (the general form of the Lamé and Darboux equations). We uploaded this code onto this Github repository:\nhttps://github.com/ericc2023/DarbouxSimulation.\n\nHowever, Alex, Dave, and I are currently extremely busy. Personally, I have a summer camp that runs from 6/12-6/18, entirely covering the 6/15 deadline. As such, we don’t forecast that we can create a quality Interim Report by the 6/15 deadline. Is it possible for us to have a small, 7-day extension on the deadline?", "Attachments": ""},
