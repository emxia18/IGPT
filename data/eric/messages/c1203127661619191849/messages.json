I was never intending to disrespect you in any way whatsoever. **I respect, have respected, and will respect your leadership and status as a researcher.**\n\nI’m still very new to doing professional research, so I don’t have much experience when it comes to things like contacting a professor. This is a learning opportunity, and I’ve taken away a valuable lesson so, in the future, I’ll be much more aware of everything like this. \n\nI contacted Sanmi only because I was trying to move as quickly as possible on all fronts of our project; I was really stressing about the ICLR abstract and submission deadline in a month’s time. That is all. I wasn’t intending to bypass your involvement, but only to get things done quickly and report back to you. \n\nTo be clear: **I never asked Sanmi to do anything at all without your expressed approval**; I was only asking him for his opinion on we should do in this situation. I realize that this was out of line, and I will reflect on this and do better in the future.\n\nI’m super grateful for everything you’ve done for me and for the project.
