I dislike geometry and combinatorics, but the magnitude of my dislike of geometry is larger than the magnitude of my dislike of combo. Other than math, I enjoy playing the piano, playing league of legends, and biking. I also LOVE eating pineapple pizza. I don't like La Croix sparkling water because it tastes bitter and disgusting. I also don't get why people hate raisin-oatmeal cookiesâ€“I mean, sure, they're stigmatized because they're \"healthy,\" but they provide a nice, fiber-full snack that won't give you diabetes.", "Attachments": ""}
