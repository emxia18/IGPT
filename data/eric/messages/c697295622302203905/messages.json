As a result, we're having an online practice on Zoom. This will start at the usual time of 3:30 PM.\n\nPlease join the practice at this link: https://wayzataschools.zoom.us/j/6539439405?pwd=VmpTZy9QOVNDYjZFdmtsWXBLZFlIdz09\n\nFeel free to let us know if you have any questions.

We ask that you check for your name in the rounds and rooms you will be competing in. You should be playing in three different packets for each of your two majors. For instance, if I am majoring in Earth/Space and Biology, then I will play packets ESS 1, ESS 2, ESS 3, BIO 1, BIO 2, BIO 3 over the course of both days, in some order. **Please check that your schedule plays exactly three different packets for each of your majors.**\n\nAdditionally, **please check that you are not playing in two rooms in the same round. In the event that there is an error for your schedule** (e.g. not playing three different packets per major or playing in two rooms at the same time), please let us know ASAP. Hopefully, this will prevent any confusion on tryout day.\n\nAnd just as a reminder, please be courteous and respectful during tryouts.\n\nBest of luck to everyone!", "Attachments": ""},
