You throw two darts, and your second dart lands farther from the center than your first dart. Now, you throw a third dart. What is the probability that it also lands farther from the center than your first dart? Assume your skill level stays constant throughout, and each throw is independent.\n\nI immediately thought to use conditional probability to solve this question. Let the distances of the three darts be three random variables X, Y, Z. Then, this probability is:\n\nP(Z > X | Y > X) = P(Z > X and Y > X)/ P(Y > X).\n\nHere’s was my solution: Since the throws are independent (in particular, Z and Y should be independent right?),  P(Z>X and Y>X) = P(Z>X) P(Y>X) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 (by symmetry). This makes the total probability 1/2.\n\nHowever, the real solution is: X,Y,Z can have any of 6 orderings with equal probability. In 3 of those orderings is Y>X, and in 2/3 of those orderings is Z>X. Thus, the probability is 2/3.\n\nWhat was wrong with my intuition about independence?", "Attachments": ""},
