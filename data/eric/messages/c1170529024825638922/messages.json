Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\nSolution:\nLet's think step by step The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nLet's think step by step We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nLet's think step by step If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n...\nFind the least number $A$ such that for any two squares of combined area 1, a rectangle of area $A$ exists such that the two squares can be packed in the rectangle (without interior overlap). You may assume that the sides of the squares are parallel to the sides of the rectangle.\n\nSolution:\nLet's think step by step.", "Attachments": ""},
