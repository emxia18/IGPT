The AMS specifies that any usage of their work must be under a license from the AMS (MAA may have similar policies though we were unable to find any)\n2. Publish the dataset with a similar Legal Compliance notice as the MATH dataset paper. In this case, it‚Äôs somewhat likely that we won‚Äôt receive any legal trouble from the MAA, as they don‚Äôt seem to have taken legal action against MATH in the three years since its release. However, it may be a potential source of trouble in the future. Interestingly, we noticed that the MATH dataset‚Äôs claim that the AoPS uses the MAA‚Äôs problems without their permission is wrong.
