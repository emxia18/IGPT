Not a bad idea

Bruno Dumont: I sent you something about the psych class
but I figured it out
did u do the paper analysis thing?


Ziyad Broker Stanford: not yet
Bruno Dumont: they are very sneaky
cause they made us read the paper on the juggle experiment
and they ask us to differentiate what was said in class
and what is on the paper
we should check if we have the same things
cause I'm not 100% positive I remember everything said in class
