Bruno Dumont: Hi Blair this is Bruno Fiona's boyfriend. Its her birthday tomorrow and I wanted to make her a mini surprise baking party on Saturday around 3 pm I'll buy stuff so we can bake egg tarts. We will probably do it on sally ride do you think you can make it? You don't need to bake if you don't want we might play some games too.


Blair Schooling: Omg i am so in for that
