Pretty Girl 🐦: 🐦
Give my playlist a listen: альт-рок и эмо https://spotify.link/qaobFgbveDb
Bruno Dumont: 🐧
Quando bate aquela saudade - Rubel
Both the musics you liked


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thanks bro, you have great music taste
Bruno Dumont: The vladmir putin one was also great


Pretty Girl 🐦: I gotta show you some more songs I like, we’ll find one you like
Bruno Dumont: But i think I prefered vodka


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: Sure
Hey I’m at stern rn
At the entrance U showed me last time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Here
We are done, text me when you are
Bruno Dumont: Were not yet


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m ready
Bruno Dumont: Ready as well
Do you wanna come here or do I go to stern?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m heading out rn
I’ll meet you at the cross road
Actually meet me at the stern cuz it’s in the same direction
Bruno Dumont: Ok
Going to stern


Pretty Girl 🐦: The donner entrance is like 5 steps from the fair
Bruno Dumont: Hi Fiona
I think we just did things to fast
I was kinda scaried
But I want to try this out
If you want to
You seemed to really like me (and I like that) but I think we tried to take a step bigger than our legs
If you want to this we can take things slowly


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey, yeah I agree
Bruno Dumont: Util were both confortable


Pretty Girl 🐦: To your second text
sorry I keep comparing you to my ex, I use it as a defense mechanism when I’m scared. But it’s very unfair to do that to you
Bruno Dumont: I was no worried about that


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll think about this when I’m more rational haha
Bruno Dumont: I think that I was scared I didnt get over my past relationships as well
When you said that
It was too fast
But I’m confident it wont be a problem


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m feel bad for implying it was too soon, because that should be your opinion, not mine to make
Anyways
Time is the universal solvent
So we should talk bout this later
Bruno Dumont: Im pretty sure thats water thogh


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, I thought you didn’t know shit bout chem🤔
Bruno Dumont: I have my misteries
We have to get to know each others better
In Brazil its pretty common to kiss but it usually takes people a moth to form relationships
Thats where I think the problem was


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah maybe it was. But no matter what happens, we should try to stay friends cuz you are cool af
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
Just think if you want to try this out
If you feel like it
We can try


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes I will. Thanks for giving me time
Bruno Dumont: Ok then

Bruno Dumont: Maybe

Bruno Dumont: I dont know were it si


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha just head towards Branner then I
Bruno Dumont: Ok
Im in front of branner


Pretty Girl 🐦: There is only brunch tmr, so no breakfast
Bruno Dumont: U R A Q T


Pretty Girl 🐦: So remember how I told you how slow people in China take physical touch?
For me, physical touch = emotional closeness
But that’s not what it means for you
So it’s confusing for me
Bruno Dumont: Physical touch is great
Thats why I do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know. But hear my logic
I see physical touch as something people do when they are really into each other, usually in a relationship
But we have different concepts
Bruno Dumont: You want me to stop then?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Idk, I just want to tell you how I feel
Bruno Dumont: Tell me in the time it happens
If u like it or not
So I can know what to do


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🦑
I’m going to bag check
It’s far
Bruno Dumont: Ill save a place to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I won’t be able to find you again lol
Bruno Dumont: You will


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nah
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: I haven’t event gotten to the place yet
Bruno Dumont: Ill save you a place

Bruno Dumont: Ill look for u
Just tell me when u arrive at stadium

Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m on the side walk area
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Not in the seat area
The highest place possible
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: You won
I’m going to sleep rn
Lol
I’m just too tired


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck, I was just about to text you something
Bruno Dumont: I can text though


Pretty Girl 🐦: That might disturb your sleep
Bruno Dumont: Just dont wanna get out of bed
No worries


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok you ready, it’s a bit long
Bruno Dumont: Just let it out


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think we should stay friends. You are a pretty great human being and anyone would be lucky to have you; we just don’t fit other very well romantically.
For one, I’m still learning to communicate and identify my feelings, and my improvements are too slow for what you and me need.
I also feel like most times we focus on your enjoyment but not my enjoyment. I pushed myself to go check out parties and sports games cuz I wanted to hang out with you and I thought it would make you happy, even though I don’t enjoy these things. I’m giving up too much in exchange to hang out with you. I also want to prioritize my own happiness now.
So yeah, if we keep the option of dating open, I would feel pressure to do thing I don’t enjoy to hang out with you. It is not your fault, since ultimately it is my choice. But I honestly think it would benefit both of us to just be friends. You would feel less pressure as well I think.
Bruno Dumont: Ok then
I was thinking about it as well
It was a great try though
At least you got out your first kiss
Dont worry about it
You shoudnt to it
I just didnt realize you disliked it so much
I also dont do it too often I just was experiencing something new
And i kinda liked it
Lets just be friends than nothing will really change
From how it was a few days ago
I promisse not to make things akward


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thanks for being understanding Bruno 🥺
I’m glad you are my friend. I really do like you as a human being
Bruno Dumont: I thoght you liked me as a puppy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah, you are still a cute puppy 🫳🐶
Bruno Dumont: I was thinking about it as well
I think that if we had taked it more far
I would end up having a relationship that doesn’t satisfy what I need
And the breakup would be very harsh
Now that the window is closed I can talk about how I experienced relationships more openly
Its just that I dont talk about exs with people I’m hitting on


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah that was my fear as well. I’m glad I man-ed up for once
To say what I’m feeling
Bruno Dumont: I didnt get it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh read my last two messages as one sentence. I accidentally sent it on two parts
Bruno Dumont: Ok
Being that way
I’m going to sleep
I just hope that this experience
Make a similar change my first relashionship made in me
It made me realize that it someone cool was interested in me I was in fact interesting
And that made me look to my qualities with diferent eyes
You’re a person who deserves someone great who can provides what you need
So be more confident in yourself
But do you want me to keep this a secret or you dont mind?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you for the advice. I hope I can be more self assured as well.
If they ask, I don’t mind you telling.
Bruno Dumont: Its not like im going to spread it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, I’m glad you won’t
Bruno Dumont: I just wanted to make sure its alright for u


Pretty Girl 🐦: thats very kind of you
Bruno Dumont: Because its ok if you wanna keep it a secret
But if you dont mind I just wont worry about it


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Left in a hurry huh 😂
You’ll lose your visa because of this serious criminal offense
Bruno Dumont: Shit

There’s nothing I can do to prevent the lost of my visa?
If you know what I’m saying 💰?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmm I’ll send in a good word to the judge if you give me $20
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck you got me
But I don’t have that kind of money
Bruno Dumont: No worries
You can work for me to pay
Slavery work and that kinda stuff


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can give you 500 sparkling water
Bruno Dumont: So chinese right?
Plase don’t give sparkling water
You dont have to pay I’m sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: So please just get this shit far from me

Bruno Dumont: Fuck

Bruno Dumont: Kinda


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🫳🐶
Bruno Dumont: I'm feeling kinda lost as well

Pretty Girl 🐦: Explain more about how you feel
Bruno Dumont: don't want to bother you rn you have important shit to do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nah, I got time
Bruno Dumont: I just have a question
about the homework


Pretty Girl 🐦: Kinda
Bruno Dumont: how do I know if I have homework to do before class or not


Pretty Girl 🐦: You teacher will prob email you or post about it on canvas
Bruno Dumont: Then I think I'm ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lucky
Bruno Dumont: I don't know thogh
I just hope I didnt miss the homework


Pretty Girl 🐦: Unlikely but It’s also ok if you do. Your teachers will understand
Bruno Dumont: I just fell like I don't know shit about college


Pretty Girl 🐦: And who does
Bruno Dumont: I didn't knew how to plan the courses
how to select the classe
the homework
I didn't knew even how to wash my clothes


Pretty Girl 🐦: So? You learn how to, that’s the most important part.
If you already knew everything, why come to college
Bruno Dumont: I just feel unprepared for college i dont know
I think is just anxiety from classes starting


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok to feel unprepared. I feel the same. But im also confident I can handle what ever comes
Because I’ve been doing that all my life, handling and learning things
You too
Bruno Dumont: yeah
I went to the branner wars today
and felt so lost


Pretty Girl 🐦: What is that
Bruno Dumont: it was like a "party" with some games for the people from branner
everybody seemed to blend in very well and I was just lost
I'm just not used to being so lost
I like to have things under my control and understand what I need to do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm I really do understand how you feel.
But idk how to make you feel better :(
Bruno Dumont: I know you do you kinda already got to the stuff I'm going through rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Trust me, I’m still experiencing it
Bruno Dumont: I think just talking with someone who understands how you feel is good enough


Pretty Girl 🐦: hug hug
Bruno Dumont: I feel like you're the only person I already went above the superficial talk level in friendship


Pretty Girl 🐦: So what are you so busy with that you can’t go to dinner
You’ll meet more of them. Just takes time.
Bruno Dumont: I was looking some air plane tickets
and I had to stop to cry for a bit so I have to ge tmy shit together before heading to dinner


Pretty Girl 🐦: If strategy board games taught me one thing, it’s patience and steadiness
Relatable
I don’t wanna talk with my mom cuz I feel like imma cry
Bruno Dumont: I knew I needed to cry
thats why I called my mother


Pretty Girl 🐦: I missed home a ton during my first week in the US
I would cry when my roommate fell asleep
But everything gets better so
Bruno Dumont: I cant tell exactly how much of my feelings are anxiety
how much is missing home
and other shit
I just know I'm overwhelmed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, I’m overwhelmed too
But I just do one thing at a time…and I’ll come out the other end
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
I just didn't want to do shit
I'm already tired


Pretty Girl 🐦: Then rest for now, you can do them later. Or delegate to someone else
Bruno Dumont: I can't just pass my responsabilities to someone else


Pretty Girl 🐦: Depends on the situation. Like I don’t have time to look for cheap tickets
So my mom is helping me
Otherwise, imma be driven insane
Bruno Dumont: My mom said I needed to do because I can find cheaper prices here
I was looking into this shit and it drove me insane lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah…I wish I could help you more
Bruno Dumont: Don't worry
I didn't expect you to solve my problems
I just wanted to talk about them
because I don't have a lot of solvable problems


Pretty Girl 🐦: well I’m an…engineer, I wanna solve problems
Bruno Dumont: The only solution is time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Data science 💪
Bruno Dumont: thank you for the joke I was really in need


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah

Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂, oh man, that you that actually means a lot to me

Pretty Girl 🐦: Laughing is illegal
Yes you are correct
Bruno Dumont: so it must be irony


Pretty Girl 🐦: Irony is even more illegal
No emotions allowed
Bruno Dumont: that is the thing I hear the most


Pretty Girl 🐦: Then you must not have any friends beside me huh?
Bruno Dumont: correct
more like half correct
I dont have any other friends
but youre not my friend either


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: so I give you half the points


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll take it
Bruno Dumont: It's the best you can get


Pretty Girl 🐦: What if I come to office hour
Bruno Dumont: Are u asking me out?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No
Bruno Dumont: that's not chinese


Pretty Girl 🐦: 👀
Bruno Dumont: lost your half points
now you go back to 0


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh no, how terrible
Would that be a quarter instead of 0👀
Oh I read that wrong
Bruno Dumont: I know math


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oopsie, lost my humanities points as well
Bruno Dumont: I'm not like someone else in this conversation
Who majors and data science and hates math


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😿
I don’t hate math. I’m just not good at it and feel helpless
I can’t wait for you to fill your ways requirements
reading ooooo scary
Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry
I cant read what you just wrote
I'll just believe you said I'm a gentleman
(because that's the truth)


Pretty Girl 🐦: Can you read this
🖕
Bruno Dumont: I don't know sign language as well
but I know how to read this
print("fuck you")


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoooo
pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo
Go look that up
Bruno Dumont: no time
it's time to solve the sandwich problem


Pretty Girl 🐦: Your loss
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
I recognized one word, convergence
Bruno Dumont: It's the sandwich theorem that famous for limits
but proven
good luck
if you need help
I can try to help
I'm actually a good teacher
(not at all but lets pretend that's true)


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you 🐶
Maybe I’ll try out your class
Fuck I fell sleep
If people outside weren’t being loud af, I wolluldve missed my class
Bruno Dumont: when is your class?


Pretty Girl 🐦: 1:30

Pretty Girl 🐦: Nah, im not that hungry

Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll check it out!!
Bruno Dumont: Are u going for dinner?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m might be eating with another friend tonight
：（
Bruno Dumont: Ok
No worries


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg the game is aswesome
Bruno Dumont: yeah
I love puzzle games
and this kind of linguistics it's just like math


Pretty Girl 🐦: Only on PC tho

Pretty Girl 🐦: What why?

Pretty Girl 🐦: I pause my hw when you are done. I have too much, I’ll have to do it over a few days
Bruno Dumont: I don’t wanna get in the way of your work

Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha we could get a study room if you want to do work
Bruno Dumont: I dont want to
it's just some bad shit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol is the cs hw boring?
Do you wanna help me with math, or is that even more boring
Bruno Dumont: no
it's just the homework is not cs
is debugging
and tutorial on using debugging
so its just reading
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahah
Looks fun
Bruno Dumont: it is
but math is more


Pretty Girl 🐦: Agree to disagree
Bruno Dumont: I'm having so much fun in the math class


Pretty Girl 🐦: Today someone challenged my knowledge of latin
And I felt invigorated to take latin again
Bruno Dumont: cool
you should
if you want
after a breakup with the subject


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yea I’ll def take classics courses again I think
Bruno Dumont: you can still ask it out to see if it will work the second time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, but it doesn’t want me anymore
Bruno Dumont: I'm enjoin my new relashionship
just hope CS doesnt get too jealous


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
Bruno Dumont: wanna hang out?
I'll go out at 7
so I just have 3 hours


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
Where should we meet
Wanna come to donner?
We can pick a place from there
Bruno Dumont: 7
I hope I got everything right


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ha! You actually remembered
Bruno Dumont: Yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: big brain moment
Bruno Dumont: the technique is great
but do you know why I proposed the challange?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why?
Bruno Dumont: But it was win/win situation


Pretty Girl 🐦: How is it win win
Bruno Dumont: if I win the bet or if I lose the bet we would have gone to starbucks to grab a stuff. So I basically got a date with you guaranteed
If I win is a little bit better because it's for free
but that doesn't matter too much


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg I forgot about the bet 😂
Bruno Dumont: We don't have to do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: We should though
Unless you are ok with sparkling water
Bruno Dumont: I'm going to donner rn then


Pretty Girl 🐦: See ya soon then
I gotta give you the nail clippers and show you Steve’s thing
Bruno Dumont: yeah
thank you soooooo much
I was considering the possibility
of chopping my fingers off
because typing with big nails is such a pain
finished fucking homework lets go

Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha you def should cut your nails if you are going bowling
Bruno Dumont: fuck

Bruno Dumont: Yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: Not fair
Bruno Dumont: But you look great irl


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww thanks
Bruno Dumont: Sned me the name of the music
The sad one
I liked it
And one from the rock band aw


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
The first one, Deftones song is called phantom bride
I’m happy you liked it
Means you have good taste
Bruno Dumont: I’m happy you’re happy


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🥺 that’s very anti-Bruno of you
Bruno Dumont: Not actually
I’m empathetic as well
You just don’t know this side of me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well I like this side of Bruno as well
Bruno Dumont: My relationship side is actually quite unique
Maybe you’ll get to see it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah hopefully
Not sure you’ve seen my personal/private side either
But I’m trying to let it out more
‎image omitted
night biking. How’s the bowling place?
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
‎audio omitted
Nice music


Pretty Girl 🐦: There’s no music? Or am I deaf
Bruno Dumont: You’re deaf
Look at the audio there’s clearly something


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll listen to it in a quieter place
Bruno Dumont: No need


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: I’m just so shitty at bowling


Pretty Girl 🐦: You gaslighter
Bruno Dumont: It kinda makes me feel bad
My competitve side wants me to win
But it’s against my capabilities
‎audio omitted
Thats great music
Highway to hell


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just got back
Ahhh yeah I can relate. I’m also not great at bowling
So I went to play the arcade game at the bowling place instea
You are just too hard on yourself. You are great at bowling
The people in donner are pregaming. I can smell the booze just walking by the room
When you coming back?
Bruno Dumont: No idea
Its drinking before a party right?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
Bruno Dumont: Already missing me?


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🫣
https://spotify.link/3n4gOX1qvDb
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Woah looks good!
Bruno Dumont: I’m heading branner rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is it bed time?
Bruno Dumont: Is there something better to do?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No
Bruno Dumont: Nothing w/u?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll, I’m in pjs already
Bruno Dumont: Ok then
Tomorrow
Are u going to the party?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No 🤮
Lol you wanna go?
I’m just very offput by drunk people
Bruno Dumont: No way
I love my bed
And I’m not the party type
My dream friday night
Is 5 to 6 friends
Quiet place
Jazz lounge music
Play some card games for a while


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeahhhh
Bruno Dumont: Then talking filosofical stuff
Or a tabletop rpg as well
The game is an ice breaker
But the best part is the conversation after
But I also love playing it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I loved those nights in highschool where we played hidden identity games while gossiping and complaining bout life haha
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
That’s were true bonds are formed


Pretty Girl 🐦: the ancient Romans liked to recline on a couches, drink wine, eat good food, and talk with friends
That’s their idea of a dinner party (men only of course)
Bruno Dumont: I should follow their advice


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Mine were men only aw I coundt make girl friends in highschool


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cool people
Bruno Dumont: Girls are complicated


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha…me too though…jus the opposite problem
Bruno Dumont: For me it seems like girls friendships were like a social chess game
About maintaining reputation and gossiping about each other


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo, that is not how I would describe my friendships
Bruno Dumont: While the men friendships were a competition of who can say more shit in a lunch table
That’s what I saw in my highschool of course its not the same for eveyone


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah ok
My friends were crazy (in a good way) and they accepted my weirdness as well. So no worries about reputation. We knew enough blackmail information about each other that we could end each others careers lol
Crazy as in crazy nerdy about something
Bruno Dumont: Normal friendship
I ger it
I was in the group of nerds aw
But we were the nerds that were somewhat social adept
So we were kinda respected instead of being the weirdos
But hey when u have time have a look on the video I sent you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruh that ending
😂 must have been smoking something
Bruno Dumont: This guy has a big physics and math channel
But his second channel he post humor stuff
That I really like


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah he looks familiar
Bruno Dumont: I think he’s very funny
If you liked I can show you some other videos


Pretty Girl 🐦: My humor is strange tho👀
You ain’t getting me with the conventional stuff
Bruno Dumont: I get it
Only sexual jokes


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂
Bruno Dumont: You’re so horny
But I guess that’s your friend’s fault
I remember you saying a friend told you to watch porn every time you felt sad or somethint like that
And you’re the sad girl
So that is to be expected


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, she told me quote if I’m stressed, just go watch porn
Doesn’t work though
Bruno Dumont: Of course not
The advice i give is if you’re horny just watch porn
It you’re stressed
Take a long warm bath


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmm yeah
I used to read manga and fan fiction to relieve stress
Bruno Dumont: I like manga
But I usually read korean/chinese ones the ones with color


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahhh yeah me too
Man I haven’t checked the updates in forever
Is your roommate at the party?
Bruno Dumont: I check every day
No he has training


Pretty Girl 🐦: My roommate is idk where
I hope I don’t have to smell booze tonight
Bruno Dumont: I have like 30 i like
Every day I check the new chapters
Theres usually 3-4 new chapters


Pretty Girl 🐦: What kind do you read?
Bruno Dumont: The mangas are my brainded activity
So all of them are like cliche stuff
I just turn off my brain and read
I can show you some if you want
But I dont think you’ll like it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah let’s see
I was reading this one recently. very funny
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Bom dia
I was actually a little to naive
I have some college 101 homework to do
I just don't understand wtf should I do


Pretty Girl 🐦: What’s the assignment
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well what’s in the directions?
Bruno Dumont: It tells me to write down between 2 to 5 sentences of the reading I did
But it doesn't tell me what to read
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: What’s in “click here”
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
‎image omitted
I'll just figure out some stuff
don't need to worry
I was just doing some small talk


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah you could always email if confused
man I don’t wanna get out of bed
Bruno Dumont: I had to because I had a quiz for CS 106B and I wanted to be free of this shit in the morning


Pretty Girl 🐦: A quiz in the first week?
Bruno Dumont: yeah
I got 10/10


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nice
Bruno Dumont: it's extra points


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like a syllabus quiz?
I have to do that as well lol
Bruno Dumont: it was a quiz about the subject of the class
4 questions about the c++ stuff he teached


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm I see
Bruno Dumont: and 1 question about what happend in class
he actually had a question about which misfortune happened to him during class (he spilled water on his computer)


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol
Yesterday…I got woken up by noise at 2am. But I thought it was my alarm and that it was morning.
And I layed in bed listening to the voices outside my door
And my confused brain thought I heard your voice
Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry I'll be more quiet next time


Pretty Girl 🐦: So I got out of bed, and was about to open the door
When I heard my roommate wake up. And that made me wake up more
And I was like why would you be here
Lmaoo and then I realize it was 2am not morning yet
Bruno Dumont: I was stalking on you 2 in the morning
Today 6 am a group of people decided to come in front on branner
and scream


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahaha
Bruno Dumont: "join the band"
a lot of times


Pretty Girl 🐦: Great first impression
Bruno Dumont: luckly I was already awake
but I got pretty confused
I had a really strange dream


Pretty Girl 🐦: What happened?
Bruno Dumont: I was in the war and then people started throwing grenades at us
but the grenades were like bouncy and had a lot of time before they exploded
so we had time to kick it out of the range and be safe
but it was kinda hard and I remember a lot of people close to me losing their arms and legs to the grenades and I was desperate to kick them far from me
and there was a kid who went crazy and tried to kick the grenades in my directions and I tried to kick it back like a hot potato
and really creepy
I woke up so confused/in fear that I didn't even try to go back to sleep


Pretty Girl 🐦: Huh a stress dream
I hate those
Bruno Dumont: In the beginning it wasnt so stressful
but when the kid tried to kill me while kicking grenades ay my direction
that it started to become more creepy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you like to analyze dreams or do you think dreams are just weird brain activity
Bruno Dumont: I think they can tell things about you
because it was your brain who created it
but I don't know how much
but what I'm 100% sure
it's that they can't be used to see the future


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmm, I wonder why you dreamt of another human trying to hurt you then
Bruno Dumont: I don't know
But the dream I have everytime


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a common dream?
That’s interesting
Bruno Dumont: is I dream about the olimpic weak I told you about
I think that my brain wants to put a lot of friends from deferent parts of my life in my dream
and to become more reasonable he just pick a random place and say that it is the olimpic weak thats why my grandmother my best friend and the guy I know from third grade are all on the same place


Pretty Girl 🐦: Interesting
I never dream of people I know
Bruno Dumont: really?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes. I would know the people in my dream, but they don’t exist in reality
Just random ass people my brain crates
Bruno Dumont: Stop lying
You dreamed about me
in the last 7 days
every day
twice


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
In reality no
But when I wake up, you are in my thoughts almost every second
(,,>﹏<,,)
It’s because I talk so much shit about you to everyone
/j
Bruno Dumont: You already said it
don't try covering it out
It's not working


Pretty Girl 🐦: You have to respect my beliefs. You are in America
Bruno Dumont: You can believe in wtv you want
but the truth
It can't be changed


Pretty Girl 🐦: There is no truth, only speculation
Bruno Dumont: I don't like reading assigments
But I can read you like a book


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂 you only read what I want you to read
Have you thought about that
Bruno Dumont: Yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: Uh oh
Bruno Dumont: Why the fuck would I read something I don't like
I just read what I want to


Pretty Girl 🐦: good luck on your actual reading though, let me know if you wanna discuss
Not sure if you got my point so I’ll reiterate. I am the author of myself. You might think you can read me, but in reality, you are only reading what I have written for you to see
Ooo metaphors
I love metaphors. Beautiful like a puppy
Bruno Dumont: I got what you said
But you’re half right
Because there’s only so much you can hide


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah? ૮ ･ ﻌ･ა
Bruno Dumont: You can choose the words you write down
But there’s so much between the lines that you can’t cover up


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well said
It’s a shame you don’t like the humanities more
Bruno Dumont: maybe I like


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think you two would find value in each other
Bruno Dumont: but didn't got the chance to experience it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh
Bruno Dumont: Maybe it's like math
I could like more If I see something good
but humanities at my school was just so fucking boring
memorizing historical facts
or in linguistics having to know 47 different rules to write and accent in portuguese


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah that doesn’t capture the essence and goal of the humanities
Bruno Dumont: neither does math at school covers the essence of math


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Bruno Dumont: that's why highschool sucks


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s why I’m so interested in education
Bruno Dumont: specially at Brazil


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s so important, yet no one in power cares
Because they use it as a tool to do crowd control
Bruno Dumont: How would you introduce me to the real point of humanities?


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s a very hard questions. (how would you introduce me to the real point of math?) and I’m not a great teacher. However, I would prob start with this book
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: It's already a hard start
books


Pretty Girl 🐦: And have you discuss the short excerpts with a good group of studnegsv
It’s not a full on book. It’s short excerpts from Greek philosopher
Bruno Dumont: discussing seems cool


Pretty Girl 🐦: Very short paragraphs, easy to read
Bruno Dumont: Answering your question
To introduce you to the real point of math
For me math is about patterns recognitions and not about perfoming calculation
There's a saying I like that says math is everything else you can't do with a calculator
I think someone can only enjoy math when they see clever and creative solutions to problems


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmmm just like how history is not about memorizing historical facts
But they are important to know
I can see your point
Bruno Dumont: I think to see why I like math I would introduce to game theory
maybe not exactly game theory
but math games in general


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
I saw these the last time I went to the book store
Bruno Dumont: I used a poor choice of words


Pretty Girl 🐦: No idea what game theory is tho
Bruno Dumont: game theory is different from what I wanted to say
there are some questions about math games and winning strategies
for exemple
There are 2 piles of rocks both with 20 rocks. 2 players are competing and their goal is to take the last rock of the piles but on every turn you can take how many rocks you want but only from one pile. Which player has a strategie that can guarantee he will win 100% of the time?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Making the other person take a factor of 20
Oh wait we want the last
Bruno Dumont: Let's play the game
do you want to be the first or second to play?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lemme shower first yeah?
Bruno Dumont: Really already showering?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ve been standing in a towel for like 30 mins hahaha
Bruno Dumont: It's not been a month yet
👀


Pretty Girl 🐦: Let’s do the game
But why are there two piles
Bruno Dumont: that's now humanities
you don't as why


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: that's not humanities
you don't ask why
fuck I don't know how to type
20, 20
do you wanna go first or second?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll go first
2 from p1
Bruno Dumont: 18, 20
my move 18, 18


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wait there’s no limit to how many rocks you can take?
Bruno Dumont: yeah but only from 1 pile


Pretty Girl 🐦: 艹
Umm lemme think
Whatever, 1 from p2
Bruno Dumont: 17, 18
17, 17


Pretty Girl 🐦: Stop copying me
Wtf why are there two pilesb
Bruno Dumont: I don't get the question


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why make this question have two piles
It’s so much easier with 1
Bruno Dumont: yeah you just take all of them out and win
that's the trivial case
now we're playing the easy case that is 2 piles
and then you work out the general case with N piles


Pretty Girl 🐦: Does it matter who goes first
Bruno Dumont: yeah
one of the 2 players can guarantee his victory with one strategy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Did I fuck up
Bruno Dumont: your job is to find who that player is


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm give me some time on this
Or a hint
Bruno Dumont: you don't have to this if you dont want
the hint I would say is try playing games and recognizing a pattern
play with only 5 rocks on each pile


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nah, I’m gonna give it a try.
Ok
Bruno Dumont: you can play with me
I can beat you 100% of the time as long as you don't know the strategy


Pretty Girl 🐦: And you have to get the last rock form both piles? How is that physically possible
Bruno Dumont: exemple of a game
5, 5
the player who picked the last stone winned so it was player 2


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ohhh I get it more now
So it’s the last last stone
Bruno Dumont: we can do it later


Pretty Girl 🐦: Not the last stone from each pile
Bruno Dumont: if you want
in person

Pretty Girl 🐦: Then my strategy might work
Prepare to lose
Bruno Dumont: ok then

Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I’m just joking, my strategy is only half formed
Is it not always 2 players?
Bruno Dumont: player 1 or player 2
first or second


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ohh, I’m not ready yet, I still have to test it
I gotta do my Ling quiz first
Man this game is hurting my brain
Bruno Dumont: Don't do it then
I just showed you this
because math games are fun and interactive ways of solving hard math problems


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol
I think I’ll stick to liking math in a humanities way
Bruno Dumont: maybe


Pretty Girl 🐦: Brunch soon?
Bruno Dumont: Ok

Pretty Girl 🐦: It doesn’t taste good?
Bruno Dumont: Nop
But it’s drinkable


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s strange. What bout the flavors and stuff
Bruno Dumont: It’s right below the line of wanting to vomit while drinking


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you want a bagel?
That sounds very bad lo
Bruno Dumont: But the problem its that I diluted it wrong
So it was worse than normal


Pretty Girl 🐦: 👇
Oops, should be pointing up

Pretty Girl 🐦: No, they gave us food in the common room

it reminds me of a saying I like


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: "you make more friends in 2 month being interested in other people than in 2 years trying to make them interested in you"


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmm
That’s true
Bruno Dumont: But it's hard to do
especially for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
It’s hard for me too
Bruno Dumont: I have the problem of speaking more than hearing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm, it’s good that you recognize that about yourself
I think I try to listen to others too much and ignore my own thoughts
Bruno Dumont: the opposite problem


Pretty Girl 🐦: Read the scavenger hunt list
It’s…Brazil
Bruno Dumont: What?

Pretty Girl 🐦: Because the hairstyle…it’s like god…you can’t look at it directly
Bruno Dumont: I just stayed like that for a day


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I’m just exaggerating
Bruno Dumont: When I got home I just took of the dick of my head and became bald
Would you still be interested in me if I was bald?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah?
But I prefer you having hair
So I can floof it
🫳🐶
Bruno Dumont: why lol
I looked so bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why not
Bruno Dumont: I'm just kidding


Pretty Girl 🐦: But if you keep the dick hairstyle
That’s a nao
Bruno Dumont: I feel bad for my college homework
everybody seems to tryharding this shit
putting a lot of reflection and thoghts
and I just wanna finish this without being judged


Pretty Girl 🐦: As long as you are genuinely reflecting, it doesn matter how “grand” or philosophical your writing is
If people have good character, they won’t judge you
Bruno Dumont: I'm not actually reflecting


Pretty Girl 🐦: Welp
Bruno Dumont: I'm just writing down parts of the book
and explaning something
I don't know


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah taht sounds good
Comparisons is the thief of joy
Do your own thing. I trust that it’s good

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
‎sticker omitted
It’s so troublesome to add stickers
Fuck I’m becoming delusional. I’ll tell you bout it in the morning
I’m kinda scared to fall asleep now
Bruno Dumont: Are U ok?
Need any help?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m ok now. I’m just a dramatic person
Bruno Dumont: No worries
I understand how you feels
When you are in a vulnerable spot
You just want to be dramatic a bit
It kinda helps


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Yeah you are right

Bruno Dumont: ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: Are you?
Bruno Dumont: I'm chilling at branner
math psets are not out yet


Pretty Girl 🐦: 👌
Bruno Dumont: neither are the CS stuff
so I'm free for now


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nothing better than a can of sparkling water after a sunny bike ride
Bruno Dumont: I think being kicked in the balls after a sunny bike ride is better
But I’m not entirely sure


Pretty Girl 🐦: We could do an experiment
🐸
Bruno Dumont: I didnt knew you were so perverted


Pretty Girl 🐦: You don’t know the half of it
Bruno Dumont: Can I find this out?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ;) talvez
Bruno Dumont: He he boy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Huh?
Bruno Dumont: Im disappointed at my CS class
They didnt give any homework


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😒
Bruno Dumont: How tf am I supposed to learn what they teach
If I cant do it myself


Pretty Girl 🐦: Are you being serious
Bruno Dumont: Nhya
Just teasing you
Showing off my lack of homework


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo I was about to question your academic philosophy
Bruno Dumont: Basically being a dick
But I really wouldnt mind having some CS exercises to train what they teached in class


Pretty Girl 🐦: I get that

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Stealing an avançado
Avacado
Bruno Dumont: Kkkkkkkk

Avançado means advanced in portuguese


Pretty Girl 🐦: I didn’t lol. It autocorrect
Idk why
Bruno Dumont: Why did it autocorrect to portuguese?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was on the Portuguese keyboard on accident
Bruno Dumont: So cute
I dont have a portugese keyboard


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow, what a flex
Bruno Dumont: I should get one lol
That’s a flex of how lazy I am


Pretty Girl 🐦: You know they say beginners tends to buy/use a lot of useless shit
Usually we are talking about beginners in sports, but it also applies to language learning I guess
But I’m so happy I have an avocado
Bruno Dumont: What did you buy?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you like 🥑?
Bruno Dumont: I never had one


Pretty Girl 🐦: No way!
Bruno Dumont: Way


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok we have to get you some good avocado toast
Bruno Dumont: What are your plans for the night?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m gonna be hanging out in terra
Another dorm
Bruno Dumont: Let’s go making friends


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
Bruno Dumont: I thought you were messing with me
Because terra is world in portuguese (or mud)


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, it also means earth in Latin
Bruno Dumont: So I thought you were saying you will be hanging around earth
I dont know latin
Who’s going?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No one, I’m just hanging out with Ross
Bruno Dumont: I thought you were making friends
Disappointed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I am
I met some terra people
Stole their food
Bruno Dumont: Lets go thats how you make friends


Pretty Girl 🐦: Isn’t that friendship
Bruno Dumont: But you have to say that it tastes like shit after you steal
That’s what I did and felt hard for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why?
Bruno Dumont: I complained about evey single food you gave me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
Well, I’m not surprised that you don’t like it
But if you don’t like avocado
I’m gonna think you are weird
Bruno Dumont: You already think
I was trying to see if someone is up to something
Because if I stay 5 more seconds in my bed I’ll just fall sleep rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm wanna come check out terra?
I’m honestly not sure what we are gonna do
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: I lived here for 18 years I know my planet


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m helping them clean their kitchen rn 😂
This dorm is so strange
The students are in charge of making their own food and cleaning
Bruno Dumont: ‎sticker omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds like a terrível place to live
Bruno Dumont: Yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: Come with me to arrilaga for breakfast tmr and I’ll bring the avocado
Bruno Dumont: You’re going to the gym with me

Pretty Girl 🐦: Times up?
Bruno Dumont: Just turned off the lights
Took out my clothes
And went to bed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha good night puppy
Bruno Dumont: Not gonna sleep rn
Just lay here until maybe 9


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm, pat pat
I wish
I were in Branner
Bruno Dumont: I wanted a real pat
Cafuné
It’s also a word without translation I like
Means basically a pat in the head
A continuous pat in the head


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mmm I just googled it. I know what you mean
Bruno Dumont: I’ll do you some
Why?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why do I wish I were in Branner?
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
Your room is better than mime


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmmm
Because
Bruno Dumont: And u can use the common space here whenever you want


Pretty Girl 🐦: There’s someone I like in Branner. You might not know him though
Bruno Dumont: I knew it was this
Just wanted to make you say it
If wanna come here stalk me in the night
Just like I did under your bed tonight


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah watch out for me tonight ；)
Imma shave your head
Bruno Dumont: I’m not scared

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
That’s was funny. I was feeling kinda sad but I’m better now
Bruno Dumont: it switches what I said with what I wanted to say
What happened?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s the same dumb problem about math
It’s making me scared bout my future
Cuz i really don’t think I can do stem
Bruno Dumont: Have you considered talking to someone about it?
I think you should see your academic advisor
She has seen so many people with similar problems


Pretty Girl 🐦: Imma talk to my advisor maybe
Bruno Dumont: And saw the solutions each one tried and if it worked or not
I can give you my advice but I know shit about life
but from the small things I know
Is that it's impossible to know everything and so my advice is way worse then that of someone who spent their whole lifes working with this kinda situation


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, thanks for hearing me out
Bruno Dumont: no worries
if it helps
I now have psets for math and CS
i spent half an hour on a problem
just to realize I read it wrong
and had to start from scratch


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Did you know eating avocados improve reading skills
Bruno Dumont: I think you are lying to me
But I would eat it if you say is increases the probability a pretty chinese girl kisses me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww, you really like kisses huh
Bruno Dumont: Only yours


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m…idk what to respond so

Bruno Dumont: I chose this 3

Pretty Girl 🐦: Why?
Bruno Dumont: I'll finish it faster than if I try to do it
I'm very fast in homework if I'm feeling great
but if I'm tired I no joking take 5 times the time to do a homework


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah makes sense
Bruno Dumont: so I'll just play in my strength and not in my weakness


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sleep
I’m gonna sleep early today too
Today’s lecture really fucked me
Bruno Dumont: tomorrow morning abs training


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I have it again tmr
Damn
Bruno Dumont: But you know I wanted to make a more specific abs workout for you
one more inclined to your needs but it's too hard


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww I appreciate that
Wtf hahah
Bruno Dumont: It's hard because I need to see it you know
If you don't show me how am I supposed to know


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmao
There is nothing to see
Bruno Dumont: My eyes can see more than you think
you just need to take out your shirt


Pretty Girl 🐦: 👀
Bruno Dumont: for professional purposes
obviously


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂 of course
You do it first
I need to see an example
Bruno Dumont: yeah sure
no problem
just let me know when you are free


Pretty Girl 🐦: Shit I forgot you are actually willing to show off your abs
I played to your strengths 🥲
Bruno Dumont: the way you say makes me sound like a perv
I would show them to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm, well. I’m not interested
‎sticker omitted

I feel bad for laughing
But that joke fit my humor very well
Bruno Dumont: what joke?


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🙄
Bruno Dumont: what in specific
we made a lot of jokes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Taht you got depression because I’m not interested to see your abs
Bruno Dumont: yeah I know
depression
sad girl
it's the perfect fit


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m not actually sad
Wait maybe I am
Haha idk
Bruno Dumont: Why are u sad?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why are you running
Bruno Dumont: running?


Pretty Girl 🐦: You know that meme?
Bruno Dumont: I'm too tired rn
I'm not understanging what you are saying

Pretty Girl 🐦: https://youtu.be/FAB9KpZtnZs?si=xLNUjkfXxF8UkDBs
Bruno Dumont: "uga buga pretty girl uga buga"


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha puppy is being kawaii
I wanna pet your hair again lol
Bruno Dumont: I’ll let you
Eu vou deixar você fazer carinho na minha cabeça
Depois eu tenho que te mostrar umas musicas do chorão e uns sertanejos pra ver se você gosta


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ya here?
Bruno Dumont: Yup
On the abs part


Pretty Girl 🐦: You forgor
Your fucking plates
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Fuck
I’m sorry
I dont do it on purpose
I’m just that idiot


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm I’ll forgive you because you’re pretty
Omg I love Kotas
I finally understood a class 😭😭
Bruno Dumont: Kotas?


Pretty Girl 🐦: the other math prof
Bruno Dumont: great
I'm happy you liked it
you seem like you would enjoy math if presented correctly


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I know that I don’t dislike math
I just don’t like the feeling of helplessness lol
And feeling dumb
Bruno Dumont: you're not dumb
by any strecth of the imagination
intellectually speaking
you're probably top 0.01% of the world


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha thanks for the encouragement. I really need to hear it sometimes
Bruno Dumont: calling you dumb is like offending all the other people in the world


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah rationally thinking, there’s some truth in that
Bruno Dumont: of course there is
If you knew what a good high school student is in Brazil
you'd feel like literal albert einstein


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo I felt that in American high school
Bruno Dumont: you came to the place with the best students in the fucking world
and you're comparing yourself to them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzP7oDCciGI&ab_channel=TEDxTalks
take a look into it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know. Ive been warned about becoming an “average” student
But I’m ok with that. Honestly. As long as I feel like I’m learning and making progress
Bruno Dumont: but making progress isnt like this
I struggles with it as well
I can show you my personal statment
it talked about that
how I struggled with math for a year and almost gave up
but suddenly it clicked to me that even though I was't realizing I was making progress
because as you get better the class gets harder
but after you finish and compare with the beginning you'll realize how much you improved
don't worry work hard and trust the process
that's why you need to enjoy the process
because the end result will take time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, I agree
I do language learning. I know how the little steps add up
but the frustration doesn’t go away. It’s part of the process
Bruno Dumont: the frustration is not part of the process
the frustration is because of your high espectations
frustation comes from expectations that were not fullfiled
lower your standarts
and just enjoy the process
I would love to spend my whole morning talking to a pretty girl
but I have homework to do
so if you'll excuse me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe, I’m literally texting during a lectur
You are a bad influence puppy
Bruno Dumont: fuck you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Good luck on your hw
Bruno Dumont: you're the bad influence


Pretty Girl 🐦: https://youtube.com/shorts/RJRv8M20o8U?si=idc_I6xRbKgHi-4q
Bruno Dumont: That’s you
In every way
It's what we would call in Brazil
Espanta xota
repelente de buceta


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo
I don’t mind though, perhaps the xota I scare aren’t the xota I want anyways
Bruno Dumont: that sentence you wrote
is the most majestic thing I've ever had the pleasure to read
congratulations


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s the humanities brain doing it’s thing
*its
Bruno Dumont: do you know what xota is?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lemme Google
Yes I do. Isn’t it the same word from the YouTube video you sent
Bruno Dumont: nop

Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh
Bruno Dumont: there are a ton of other words


Pretty Girl 🐦: awkward
Bruno Dumont: xana
there are probably other but I can't remember rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn
I wonder why Portuguese needs so many words for vagina
And what that reflects
Bruno Dumont: vagina is also a words
in portuguese
it reflects that Portuguese is a rich language


Pretty Girl 🐦: sure 😂
Bruno Dumont: with a lot of different ways to express your ideas
even if those ideas are nonconvetional


Pretty Girl 🐦: What about the word for penis. Are there also a lot of variations?
Let’s see if this will support my hypothesis
Bruno Dumont: pinto 
there are a lot more I cant remember rn

Fascinating ESF lecture today. It’s by a math professor talking about liberal arts education
Bruno Dumont: what's the problem?
this is math racism


Pretty Girl 🐦: He raised a point that the definition of liberal arts education changes as the times changed…and we should now consider how “stem” courses like engineering fits into the liberal arts curriculum
I’ve never thought about this kinda fusion before
He also talked shit about cs majors.
Just kidding haha
And it gives a solution to the death of the “humanities department.” Damn
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted

They should make melatonin taste good for people to take it
But they shouldn’t make it taste that good


Pretty Girl 🐦: Take it with a shot of sparkling water next time
That’s like double yummy for me, but it might cancel out for you
Bruno Dumont: Why do u hate me
?
Cancel out? Its fucking disgusting


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im just so caring. I don’t want you to take too much melatonin
Bruno Dumont: Yeah sure?
But it’s not as sweet as you
The texture is not as great as your skin
And the tast is not nearly close to your mouth
So I’m a little bit more concerned about being addicted to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: This is embarrassing to read
But
Bruno Dumont: Good or bad embarrassing?


Pretty Girl 🐦: You shouldn’t stop
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I almost did
That’s not the reaction I was expecting


Pretty Girl 🐦: What were you expecting? Embarrassing is not the right word. It’s like…it makes me wanna hide because of shyness
Bruno Dumont: Ok then
Embarrassing feels bad to me
When someone hits on you you feel shy when someone tries to hit on you trip and feel with their heads on the ground you feel embarrassed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
I wanna see that happen (but not so dangerously)
Bruno Dumont: Then I’m not your guy
I’m more on the successful part


Pretty Girl 🐦: Data speaks louder than opinions
I will need to collect more data
I just love data so much
Bruno Dumont: When did I ever triped?
The only time I feel here at Stanford
Was when I saw your pretty smile


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh my awww

Bruno Dumont: See ur already moaning and I havent even started


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck you lmaoo
Bruno Dumont: Thats just me
I’m very romantic
But I’m a little horny as well


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are too good at this
Me too
Bruno Dumont: I saw
But you can let loose more
I wanna see it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Instead I’ll go do some math
Haha
Bruno Dumont: Go sleep
You are only allowed to go work out with me if you sleep before 11


Pretty Girl 🐦: Brother
Bruno Dumont: If not it’s better if you just skip it to sleep


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
We’ll see how I feel
I stole some soy milk from the dh
Bruno Dumont: I’m going to make u sleep better
For sure


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wanna try the powder with the milk
How?
Oh
Bruno Dumont: By being fucking annoying


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎Missed voice call
Bruno Dumont: If you knew just how important it is


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oops sorry, I accidentally called you lol ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: It’s your decision

Pretty Girl 🐦: Trying to.

Midnight Medo Bobo sounds different, makes me want to cry
Bruno Dumont: Go to sleep instead

Pretty Girl 🐦: Part of reason I didn’t want to get up
Ok. Me too
‎sticker omitted
Fuck the protein powder taste sooo good with the almond milk
Bruno Dumont: I’m glad you liked it


Pretty Girl 🐦: 10x better than I imagined
Insane consistency
Why do you not like milk?
Bruno Dumont: I just dont
And its easier to drink with water


Pretty Girl 🐦: Anything specific about milk?
Im dropping 2 classes now 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Really?
Just be carefull not to fall under 12


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I’m not sure yet.
The courses I signed up for are not what I was expecting
It’s ok though. I think I have room to make mistakes right now
Bruno Dumont: U have a lot of room
That’s great
Dont feel so pressured
Nobody is perfect (only me)


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll

Bruno Dumont: Pretty and dangerous
I like that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha

Bruno Dumont: Will I like what i see?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hopefully? I think my personality is mostly positive traits
Unlike yours
Bruno Dumont: Mine is not mostly

Pretty Girl 🐦: Only bad? I’ve always liked your confidence 😙
Bruno Dumont: You like me all

Bruno Dumont: If feels like u dont want to see me

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe
Bruno Dumont: I’m a man of word


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well I’m motivated to finish my work for tonight now
I was slacking off and trying not to text you
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: U can always text me if u want
But get the fuck working
Because I wont allow u to go academic mode when we are together


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Oh my
Bruno Dumont: The only mode u are allowed to enter is the horny


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm we’ll see

Pretty Girl 🐦: I need to meditate and Clear my mind of you

Bruno Dumont: Hey

Bruno Dumont: Ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im so glad it’s a warm night
Bruno Dumont: Waiting for u ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omw, ETA 1 min
Bruno Dumont: ETA?


Pretty Girl 🐦: estimated time of arrival

Bruno Dumont: Where?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Meditation be like
Bruno Dumont: Ha ha ha
Teu cu


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe, you do all the meditation. I’ll just steal your happiness by being around you
Bruno Dumont: You dont steal it
You add to it
You add a lot of good moments
Subtract some os the bad stuff
Multiply my hapiness
And so there’s no problem in dividing some with u
See another math joke


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww
‎sticker omitted
You’re so sweet
I feel the same. You’re kinda addicting
Oops I meant to say you’re kinda a dick
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Are u that interested in my dick?
What does it say?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It says “[I] really like you”
I might skip lunch today
Bruno Dumont: no worries pretty girl
I have 2 things to tell you
don't let me forget
about my morning cardio and my mom


Pretty Girl 🐦: Alright puppy, see ya later
Bruno Dumont: I just made a bet with the 61 CM guys that if I don’t finish all my cs homework today
They can call me any nickname they want
So I’ll be forever the ‘open balls’


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha that’s a very high stakes bet
Bruno Dumont: if I win I can pick a nickname for one of them


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo, I’m curious what its gonna be
Is there a lot of hw for cs?
I’m recharging with music rn to get ready for a 2 hour ESF
Bruno Dumont: It's all the homework for the week
and it is a 5 unit course
so it's supposed to be 10 hours of homework


Pretty Girl 🐦: BRUH
You know your limits I suppose ‎<This message was edited>
All I can do is wish you much
*luck
Bruno Dumont: Hey Fiona
it's 10 hours for human being
I'm a demigod
I'll do it in 2
Caralho
My mind is a jelly rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: You’re insane. I wanna see what’s going on in that cute brain of yours
‎sticker omitted
Why are you challenging yourself to do this?
Bruno Dumont: I want to do it
I want to finish my homework fast
I want to push myself into programming
I wanted to make a funny joke
I wanted to pick a nickname for someone
I wanted to prove to myself I can focus if I want to
I wanted to prove to myself that if I'm ever in a situation I have a shit ton of work to do I can do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Seems Reasonable ‎<This message was edited>
I’m too brain dead to think rn…I’ll think later
Bruno Dumont: I finished
"finished"
I could very well send this hw rn and receive like 95% of the grade
but I know there's a bug in my code
somewhere
inside of it
there's a bug
but other than that I'm done with this shit


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just took a Power Nap but it was not enough
Bruno Dumont: it is not a bug
I'm an idiot
I did it
finished this shit
let's go


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nice
What was it
If you wanna explain
Bruno Dumont: basically
i programmed a search engine
you type what you want to search and it gives you all the url of the code
I typed the wrong word
and so I got the wrong result


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh lol
Nothing stops the user from being a dummy I guess
Bruno Dumont: yup
nothing stops me from being a fucking retarded
did you relax a bit?


Pretty Girl 🐦: A bit yes...I wish I could nap more but I gotta go to Frosh
Bruno Dumont: when is your frosh?


Pretty Girl 🐦: 4:30
To 5:50
Bruno Dumont: and do you have a lot of homework?


Pretty Girl 🐦: One long assignment.
Dinner at 6?
Bruno Dumont: Ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I really want a hug
You think you can schedule that into your calendar?
Bruno Dumont: yup
I have frosh 7:30 PM
I can hang out with you after that
I did enough for today already


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah you did, pat pat
Bruno Dumont: but I'm working on my math pset rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Only if you want to. Don’t force yourself if you are tired
Bruno Dumont: Hey
I always can hang out
unless you want to do psets during our hangout
It is something refreshing not consuming


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I’ll remember not to do that
Also I realized what was making me feel so tired and bad
Bruno Dumont: what?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was hungry 😂
Bruno Dumont: fuck you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I got some snacks during frosh and I’m alive again
Bruno Dumont: I though you were going to say a beautifully life reflection
that would reveal what was the deep cause of you tiredness
but it was just hunger


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahhaah
Well, it was very a deep reflection for me
I literally thought I was sick
Bruno Dumont: Hey
Where are u sitting


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m still in line
You pick a spot
Bruno Dumont: Sitting outside in the otero part


Pretty Girl 🐦: 👀
Bruno Dumont: Whats up?
Wanna see me again?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah but I shouldn’t
Bruno Dumont: Probably shouldn’t
Have a lot of work?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahhh
Yeah…I’ll try to finish today so I can have more time tmr
Bruno Dumont: I wont have that much time


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s ok
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, that’s pretty bad
Bruno Dumont: We can meet after 7:30


Pretty Girl 🐦: We’ll see how you feel
Bruno Dumont: Did you do the values stuff on frosh?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Mine changed ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: What values did you select?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I did this in freshmen year of highschool
We had to pick just two. I did love (which is kinda like belonging for me) and meaningful work
What about you
Bruno Dumont: I didnt see love in the list
But I think mine are easy the guess


Pretty Girl 🐦: Happiness and
Community?
Bruno Dumont: Friendships


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
Bruno Dumont: My life philosophy
I would trade it for relationships though


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a good one
Bruno Dumont: Because it’s more broad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, that’s why I picked love
Cuz I think that’s the root of any relationship
Bruno Dumont: That’s not true for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: A kinda of love for their humanity
And I mean relationship very broadly
Bruno Dumont: I don’t love any friends here but they are still important
Love for me is pretty selective
I can count in one hand how many people I love


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
I’m thinking more in this sense of love
Bruno Dumont: Well for me love has a deep meaning
I don’t know if I love my friends from Brazil
There were days I asked myself if I loved my father


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I completely understand what you mean
Ooof too relatable
Do I love someone because I have to
Bruno Dumont: My mother my grandmother and my father are the only ones I have no doubt
I don’t even love my brother


Pretty Girl 🐦: Which is understandable
I don’t feel “love” for my sister.
Ok this is a much deeper conversation
Bruno Dumont: I think I never talked with u about my brother


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because now I have a ton of questions I need to ask myself
Not a lot
Bruno Dumont: This conversation should be in person


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do want to know bout you and the other parts of Bruno
Last parting thought. I once wondered if I were psychopathic because I didn’t know if I loved my dad
Bruno Dumont: Well
If you are
We are together
But I do love him now


Pretty Girl 🐦: Woah, you gotta tell me bout what changed
Man…I wanna be with you right now
Fuck my life
Bruno Dumont: 30 minutes?


Pretty Girl 🐦: This is worse than being blue balled
Bruno Dumont: I can go there rn
If u give me 30 minutes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok. I can’t stand to say no
Bruno Dumont: Are u sure u will be alright?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Bruno Dumont: Cheguei


Pretty Girl 🐦: Does this mean done?
Bruno Dumont: I’m here

Bruno Dumont: Heading there rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎Location: https://maps.google.com/?q=37.431961,-122.174492
Bruh this looks scary
Are you here?
Bruno Dumont: Lost


Pretty Girl 🐦: Where are you?

The tunic soundtrack is PHENOMENAL
Bruno Dumont: The game is more
Look at this
my pset solution is already 4 pages long
and I've done 3 problems
problem 2 and 4 together took this 4 pages


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
Bruno Dumont: that's the guy who used drugs to do math


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: he is the mathematician that has more things published
o no it is not
I read wrong
it's another paul


Pretty Girl 🐦: Paul
You do see that Paul = 4321 right
Do you get what I mean
😂 nvm
Bruno Dumont: it is this guy
paul erdos


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, the Hungarian
Bruno Dumont: but the author is also paul


Pretty Girl 🐦: This is the only math book I know
Bruno Dumont: so that's why I tought I got confused


Pretty Girl 🐦: So what’s your Erdos number
Bruno Dumont: hmmmmm
probably less than u think


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🙄
Bruno Dumont: if we get too loose with the definition
because my best friend from highschool had a paper with a guy who is very famous in brazil
I bet his number is 2
so if you allow me to connect with my friend which we did some basic shit together I could consider myself 4
But maybe he is like 3 or 4 as well I dont know


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha alright
So am I like an 8 then
Bruno Dumont: technically we are both infinity because we dont have papers


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: but if we get a little loose with the definition yest that would make u 5-8
I'm actually 2 handshakes away from obama that's a cool fun fact


Pretty Girl 🐦: Explain please
Also my roommate got me soy milk. I love my roommate
Bruno Dumont: The sister of one of my friends from highschool is in Columbia and she met him and I met her so that's a win for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂 wow
Bruno Dumont: If she learned how to knock I would like her more


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
That’s me drinking my soy milk
Bruno Dumont: ur so cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: you’re so cute
pat pat
Unfortunately the soy is giving me the same feeling in my mouth as candy.
I’ll have to check the ingredients list after my roommate leaves
Bruno Dumont: Today in class a girl looked at me and said to my face that I’m a bad person


Pretty Girl 🐦: Was she serious or joking?
Bruno Dumont: she kinda let it slide
She wasnt trying to offend me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol ok then
Bruno Dumont: we were discurssing about morality and she was like yeah you believe this but like its because you are a bad person


Pretty Girl 🐦: Interesting thing to say
Bruno Dumont: she didnt mean to say it but she did lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh that’s joking
Bruno Dumont: I'm telling you that she 100% believes I'm a bad person
and that she said that by accident


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, well she can have her opinion
Bruno Dumont: I'm not entirely sure about this but I'm sure she thinks I'm bad lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Even though I disagree
Bruno Dumont: Yup
She is just kind of dumb


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂
Bruno Dumont: she never understand that we are having philosophical conversations
and not trying to find solutions to tangible real word problems
so she thinks that I saying that it is moral to kill a guy and puts his organs in other people she kind of associates that I would do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can understand how you feel
Bruno Dumont: but what most probable is that she thinks a good person is a person who does what they think is the right thing and by that definition I'm one of the most moral persons out there because for me what's good is what's good for me and I follow this to the line


Pretty Girl 🐦: But also not everyone is used to philosophical conversation so
Hahaha that’s most badly defined logic I’ve ever heard
Bruno Dumont: It is very common actually
because there's no non-religious way of defining what's objectively good or bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Maybe she would like Kant and the categorical imperative
Bruno Dumont: that's this
but I feel like a lot of people I talked to believe more on do what you think is good than the categorical imperative
I don't actually agree with the categorical imperative


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah it’s a very simplified way of thinking. Not practical
But there is value in it
Your experience reminds me something that happened to me.
Ehh long story short, a friend I’m not close with ‘jokingly’ called me “a terrible person” in front of my highschool advisor ‎<This message was edited>
I really cared bout what my advisor thought of me, so that comment bothered me a lot lol ‎<This message was edited>
Looking back, I find it kinda funny how upset I was
Bruno Dumont: well my school was a lot more informal
the director of my high school said to me that if I did one math problem every time I jerked off I would have won gold medal in the international competition
so I don't think he would mind that joke lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruh 😂
I think that’s just Brazil
Bruno Dumont: that's not Brazil
that's my highschool


Pretty Girl 🐦: Your director would be sued so hard if he said that in America
Bruno Dumont: but he only says this to some students


Pretty Girl 🐦: yep
Bruno Dumont: who wound't sue him


Pretty Girl 🐦: Will arrilaga be open for dinner?
Bruno Dumont: I hope so


Pretty Girl 🐦: I really want to see yo-I mean eat food
Bruno Dumont: Arrilaga is always open

Bruno Dumont: I think my method is better

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah yeah better for you only

Bruno Dumont: Ok

Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m already there
Sitting near where we were last time
Bruno Dumont: Where?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bro
I ran into charlotte and Michael
And charlotte was like I saw Bruno coming out of your room. What’s going on ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Really?
What did u say?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Michael asked if we were dating
Bruno Dumont: What did u say?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I said yeah
Is that an accurate answer
Bruno Dumont: Elaborate more on this
What was their reactions?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Charlotte said it with a teasing attitude
Michael asked in private
Idk what their reaction was. I was already close to my room when charlotte asked
Bruno Dumont: I like that
Showing my cute date to everyone
I want to see what Michael will say to me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was very flustered
‎sticker omitted
Does he talk to you a lot?
Bruno Dumont: I imagine Charlotte doing this
No but we meet about twice a week


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh well. I guess this is not a bad way for people to know
Bruno Dumont: Well
they asked probably because they heard you screaming today


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruhh😂
You are good but not that level yet
;)
Bruno Dumont: you say that now
but when I was touching u
you coudnt even speak
and once again I shattered your expectations
and impressed you again


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
can’t deny that
Bruno Dumont: yup
that's because I'm not fullpower yet


Pretty Girl 🐦: Morninggg
Bruno Dumont: Bom dia
Slept well?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mostly!
you?
Bruno Dumont: today I slept
from like 9 pm to 7 am


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damnn sounds nice
Continuously?
Bruno Dumont: almost


Pretty Girl 🐦: I always gets freaking woken up in the middle of the night
Bruno Dumont: Finished the first draft of my resume
It turned out not that bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nice!!
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: My bullshit skills are still strong
but what I did was basically transcript my application to a resume
and add the fact that I'm a Stanford student
Let me know when u head to arrillaga


Pretty Girl 🐦: Interesting. Can I see it?
Lol
Heading out in 5 mins
Bruno Dumont: yeah
I wanted an opinion
but that's just the first draft
I just wanted to do something to feel more productive


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel that
The guilt of unproductivity
Maybe we should’ve listened to Odell’s talk
But I doubt it would’ve helped
Bruno Dumont: Maçã
Bruno de Moraes Dumont - Draft 1.pdf • ‎3 pages ‎document omitted

Pretty Girl 🐦: Cool beans, I’ll read it before dinner

Bruno Dumont: ur very lucky
20 more minutes she would catch me with u again


Pretty Girl 🐦: I knowwwwwwww
Thank you god for sparing me this time
Bruno Dumont: imagine if she came back yesterday
would be very funny


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would
Kms
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: The door was locked
But you would need to scream like
Please don’t open
And there’s no way I could scape without being seen
https://youtube.com/shorts/twJOljBbfDo?si=g2cnNSVN-g24WOOL


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo I can really see his passion for big dicks
Bruno Dumont: that reminded me of you
for some strange reason I dont remember rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m speechless
But your assessment is inaccurate
Bruno Dumont: what is inaccurate?
I didnt asses shit


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
Bruno Dumont: It just reminded me of you


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I don't know if I take it as a compliment or a dick shaming


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would never body shame someone
Bruno Dumont: I know
but it was funny though
it's like I saying don't worry I dont like pretty girls
I like you


Pretty Girl 🐦: You need a “just” in there
Bruno Dumont: I know
I'm not offended
I just made a joke


Pretty Girl 🐦: Makes a big difference
Bruno Dumont: I know you like my dick
you were like


Pretty Girl 🐦: unlike your dick
Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: "oh my god"
"aahn"
"fuck"
"yeah"
"oh my god"


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I can’t even tease ya cuz you’re not embarrassed by this shit
ill think of something tho
Don’t you worry
Bruno Dumont: You can tease me
I like it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll make you make some noise next time
Not just “I’m coming”
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxqX9GBOT0V/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Bruno Dumont: Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I was not expecting that


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah I was so focused on the ice cream
Bruno Dumont: I'm talking bout u
saying hot stuff
ur always so shy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oop I misread lol
Yeah you cant imagine how flustered I feel saying that
Bruno Dumont: I can imagine actually


Pretty Girl 🐦: Just tossed my phone away
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: And it is a good imagination
Hey pretty girl
did u take a look at the resume?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, so I have some comments on small things
Bruno Dumont: You can talk all the shit you want
That's the point on asking for help


Pretty Girl 🐦: this is a personal preference but I would shorten the description of the accomplishments section. E.g. the first one you say “gold and bronze medalist….3rd out of 6 mil.” I would leave out the 3rd out of 6 mil part, because the size of the number feels weird and you don’t need to include it if you already said gold medalist
Bruno Dumont: Dont need to hold back


Pretty Girl 🐦: If you really want to include it you could use a percentile? Like top 99.9th percentile
Bruno Dumont: I'll keep that in mind


Pretty Girl 🐦: capitalization: “gold medal” no capitalization. “Brazil National Olympiad” should be capitalized like this
Last thing. The grey coloring on the left is a bit hard to read.
Bruno Dumont: This one wont stay
I'll change the layout
So don't worry about this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Other than that it looks good to me.  If you want actually helpful advice, you should ask the career centre people 😂
Bruno Dumont: I will
I'm asking a lot of people
I just want to finish it out first


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep. Great start
Bruno Dumont: One of the advices I received from this guy from Brazil is that you can get a lot of things done if you just suck it up and ask for help


Pretty Girl 🐦: HA! Solid advice
Damn I need to listen to that advice
But my brain would rather me suffer alone than show weakness
Tsk tsk tsk
Bruno Dumont: I would rather suffer and succeed than the other way around


Pretty Girl 🐦: I suffer and succeed. But asking for help lessens the suffering
Bruno Dumont: Asking for help is suffering
but it helps you suceed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah I see what you mean
Bruno Dumont: Hey
I'll bike you to flomo
So wait for me at your dorm


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was just bout to ask
Bruno Dumont: 5:45

Pretty Girl 🐦: Aw Thanks!! I’ll check it out tonight
Bruno Dumont: I’m so fucking mad rn
My roommate just wont let me sleep
And 6 am tomorrow he’s waking me up


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh I’m sorry that’s happening
The fuck is he doing
Bruno Dumont: He’s working with some lights on
Its not like hes doing a lot pf noise
Its a small desk light
I know its kind of my fault


Pretty Girl 🐦: Can you sleep while covering your head
Bruno Dumont: But I just hate the feeling of being tired all day
I’ll think about a solution tomorrow morning
Buying a sleepmask or whatever


Pretty Girl 🐦: Alright, just try to relax
Bruno Dumont: I’m just so mad I can’t sleep lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can understand haha
It has happened to me befor too
My highscool roommate was eating at 1am
And her spoon kept clanking against her glass bowl
And I wanted to kill someone
Bruno Dumont: I just work so much on my schedule so thar my sleep is healthy
And it gets thrown out the window


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah unfortunately we just have to become desensitized
And talk to your roommate about it
Hope you get some rest! You can sleep in if you want. we could always go to the gym later in the day
Bruno Dumont: Hey pretty girl what are your plans for lunch?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wherever you want to go
If you don’t care, we can go to stern
Bruno Dumont: I dont care about the place
I just wanted to go rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll see ya there then!
Do you need me to open the door or no
Bruno Dumont: No
I’m sitting on zapata
‎image omitted
I'm having a great time with my CS homework
it would be more fun if I wasn't sleeping on my PC


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂
My brain is barely functioning as well
Bruno Dumont: they posted it during class and I'm done with 1/3 of it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I actually messed up today
Nerd
Bruno Dumont: what happened?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Misread the conference time with my esf prof
It’s so stupid. So she had to cancel the old reservation to make it in person. I rescheduled but forgot to change the time on my calendar ‎<This message was edited>
And when I checked this morning, I read the old email
Bruno Dumont: did you went to when nobody was there
or did you forget to go when you were supposed to?
because one is way worse than other


Pretty Girl 🐦: Missed the time. It was at 12 ‎<This message was edited>
Which one is worse
Bruno Dumont: losing the time
I prefer to waste my time
then to lose something important


Pretty Girl 🐦: not sure I understand
You would rather waste your time than the other person’s time? Yeah I agree
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
Because if I waste my time it doesn’t matter to much
I’m so tired
I’m almost sleeping
With the lights on
Unfortunately I didn’t finish cs hw
But tomorrow I’ll finish math cs college and work on my resume


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds like a very busy day tomorrow
You know your limits, don’t burn yourself out
Have a good night of sleep puppy
Bruno Dumont: Its so cute how u worry abou me


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I’m doing it to have time to fuck u on the weekends


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh my 😂
Well I’m flattered that you want me that much
Can’t deny that I’m motivated by the same thing
Bruno Dumont: Why did i took you so long to write this?
Feeling shy?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck you
Im just a slower typer
3 wpm
Bruno Dumont: Sure
Give all the excuses u want
I’m going yo sleep rn
See u tomorrow


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
That’s the pomegranate we got
Bruno Dumont: You ate it all?


Pretty Girl 🐦: You want some? I just tried that one piece cuz it’s a bit sour
Bruno Dumont: I wanted to try it
But if its not good then it’s allright


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
Yeah you won’t like it
Cuz I kinda enjoyed the sourness
My lunch time is weird today cuz I have class 12:00. So don’t worry about being on time
Bruno Dumont: I'll try my best
I just have to take my clothes off first
and then I'll run straight for it
Hey pretty girl
Where are u sitting?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I went to get food
sally ride
Bruno Dumont: Oh my god
I just got in my bed for 5 min
Almost slept 2 times
And I can’t get out


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah cute sleepy puppy
I was in my ESF class. The classroom is so beautiful. Dark brown wood, golden sunlight, rustling leaves outside, and very very warm.
All I could think was how it’s such a perfect place for a nap ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: That's so you
but that's not the perfect place for a nap though


Pretty Girl 🐦: You calling me a bad student? ><
What’s the place for a nap then?
In your arms? ;)
Bruno Dumont: my lap
but oh my fucking god
the amount of bullshit I'm having to write on this college essay should be prohibited
it is so much harder to write this shit than I imagined
it is so fucking bad I disagree with a lot of what I'm writting
but it is different and good enough to show that I at least tried my best


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why don’t you write what you want to say? Is your response based on your readings?
Bruno Dumont: because I have nothing to say
what can I add on evolution of species
in the terms of education
like it is not like I'm saying something I disagree
it is just not what I would say
at least I finished this shit
I don't care


Pretty Girl 🐦: Interesting approach to the topic
Im sure your prof’s comments will be more helpful than mine
Bruno Dumont: The problem is I don't care
I don't want to write a good text
I don't want to learn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I can see that
Bruno Dumont: I just want to be done with it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Very understandable
Bruno Dumont: That's not the mindset I have on the classes I chose
I want to learn math and I want to learn how to code


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I can understand
Bruno Dumont: But I don't give a single flying fuck about my man Charles Darwin and his education


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Just like how I can’t give a fuck bout convergence
Bruno Dumont: I wont major in bullshit though


Pretty Girl 🐦: ???
Bruno Dumont: I dont need this shit for my major
it's not like I hate math and will major in data science


Pretty Girl 🐦: You can’t survive without relatively good writing/bullshitting skills
Bruno Dumont: that's what I'm training for
wrote 1200 words in 30 minutes
all of them are bullshit


Pretty Girl 🐦: …

My roommate is getting me unsweetened almond milk

Bruno Dumont: I'm glad you liked it
I have to give you something better then
In you birthday


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww, no pressure though. You could give me a cool leaf and I’ll be happy
Bruno Dumont: No


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂 you don’t get to decide how I feel about cool leaves
Bruno Dumont: I won't let someone steal you from me because they gifted you a better gift


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahaha
Bruno Dumont: I played enough stardew valley to know that gifting people what they like is the only way to get into a relashionship
I don't want you cheating on me with your lesbian god roomate


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooo
Lolll I wonder if that’s a reflection of the game creator. Maybe their language of affection is gift giving
Bruno Dumont: I just think it's because it makes a lot of sense in the game design


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well in Detroit: become human, it was all about what you say and what you do
so it was a deliberate choice
Bruno Dumont: yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: Or maybe just a lazy choice to have gift giving as the way to build relationships
Bruno Dumont: but it is totally different game
you have little to no talking in the game


Pretty Girl 🐦: Then why build relationships
Bruno Dumont: Don't know caralho


Pretty Girl 🐦: When can you eat dinner tonight?
Bruno Dumont: I'm free
but i have frosh at 7:30


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you have a late cs discuss?
Oh right
My frosh ends 5:50. So does 6 sound good?
Weirdly miss seeing ya ✨
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: https://rdeapps.stanford.edu/dininghallmenu/
Bruno Dumont: all of them had burger today
there's no way in hell I can do my cs homework rn
I'm so fucking tired


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah it seems the food is not that different across dhs
Lay on your bed, set a 20min timer, close your eyes
Bruno Dumont: I want to finish something first
I'll use that as a reward


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh fuck that
You just said you are tired
And you are always talking bout how tired=less productivity and accuracy
and productivity is what you want
Bruno Dumont: I know I'm wrong
but I'm too tired to be healthy

Bruno Dumont: passo is step
you wanted to say posso


Pretty Girl 🐦: *posso
Yep haha
Bruno Dumont: but even posso is not quite right


Pretty Girl 🐦: How would you say it
Bruno Dumont: because that means like you physically cant get out of bed
if you're just tired you can say nao consigo nem get outta bed
But dont worry about this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh ok
Bruno Dumont: Just letting you know

My midterm was graded

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yooooooooo
That’s awesome
Bruno Dumont: I’m a little disappointed
But not that much
A little relieved
That I didn’t screwup so bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: You gotta admit that’s an amazing grade
You’re talking bout math 61
At Stanford
Bruno Dumont: I know
But that argument dont make sense
Because it is not a good grade compared to how much I can do


Pretty Girl 🐦: This is a true “tai 6 le” moment
Bruno Dumont: what?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Uhh, 🤙🤙
Forgot you don’t speak mandarin
Bruno Dumont: because there's no le at the end


Pretty Girl 🐦: Le sounds like luhh
Bruno Dumont: in my head it was more like taliola/tailiola


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep yep, it’s written like tái liú le
Hope you feel a bit better tonight?
XXI ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I am fine

So better be prepared for it


Pretty Girl 🐦: ><
Bruno Dumont: I'm really not sad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, I don’t take back my words
Bruno Dumont: my emotions really fade in 10-15 minutes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok great
Bruno Dumont: And I'm a little relieved about the homework
The midterm
2 people I talked to got grades similar to mine


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I would be too
imma go do my ESF now :(((
We have to watch a film
I wish you were here
Bruno Dumont: What film?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Paths of glory
An old war film
I don’t enjoy anti war films. It makes me so sad watching human destruction and gore
Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry pretty girl
wish I could hug you after
I just want to let you know I enjoy the fact that you care about me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can give you an extension (to tomorrow morning) since I am so kind
Awww thanks for telling me that
It’s impossible not to care about such a cute puppy
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I realized that I might have given you the wrong impression


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah?
Bruno Dumont: I can be kind of a dick when it comes to this
I don't know
all the attempts you had to tell me my grade is good
Or that I could try again to do the card game night
It's just that I disagree with what you are saying
not that I don't like you caring about me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think I get what you are trying to say.
But my purpose of comforting you is not to have you agree with me, but trying different ways to make you feel better
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
I know
I just didnt want you had the impression
that I don't enjoy you saying these things to me
even if I complain a bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: So I won’t think you dislike my effort. But I’m glad you clarified
The only negative thing I feel is I wish I could’ve done something more helpful. But that’s just my people-pleaser brain being anxious
Bruno Dumont: You could though


Pretty Girl 🐦: 👀
Bruno Dumont: My dick really needs a sucking
I mean
You did your best dont worry


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
Bruno Dumont: it is not something you could change


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, rationally I understand
Bruno Dumont: Just watch your movie
I wont bother u anymore


Pretty Girl 🐦: I admire your grit to cock block youself
Bruno Dumont: You wouldnt suck my dick rn
If there were a possibility
no matter how slim
I would have run for it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Who knows
I have to say, I am a bit
Bruno Dumont: a bit?


Pretty Girl 🐦: >///<
Thirsty
For water
Yep
Bruno Dumont: hope you "thirstiness" can be solved by a war movie

Pretty Girl 🐦: 🥲
Bruno Dumont: but just u know

Pretty Girl 🐦: You’re such a tease
I admire your self control
Bruno Dumont: what self control?

Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh man that’s a lot of words
Bruno Dumont: I wouldnt recommend reading
but yeah
you asked for it


Pretty Girl 🐦: TegicT9? That’s a terrible unreadable name
Bruno Dumont: yeah
what I really like about CS homework
is that all of the questions are so fucking cool
They are cool applications but all the unnecessary hardwork is done for u
so you end up coding some cool shit without much worry


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mmm that’s nice
Someone was doing 106A hw next to me in ESF
Cryptography. I took a look. No idea
Bruno Dumont: It's not as hard as it seems I promise you
I coded a mini google
but only the algorithm part


Pretty Girl 🐦: Woah
The algorithm part?
Bruno Dumont: the cs 106b part


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol what is “the algorithm part”
What is algorithm
Bruno Dumont: just selecting which pages has the word you searched for


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh ok
Very cool
I’m debating between hw and a nap
How’s your cs hw going
Bruno Dumont: Not that well
Cause I spent a lot of time finishing math and resting
coming back to do it rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nice
Lol the grind is real.
I think imma nap
Bruno Dumont: nap and do hw


Pretty Girl 🐦: At the same time 😂
Man you sound like a capitalist
How to monetize nap time
Bruno Dumont: i am a capitalist
but I meant nap for 18 minutes then do homework
is not like 18 minutes is a lot


Pretty Girl 🐦: I have frosh in 30
Dinner 5:30?
Bruno Dumont: ok
going back to my CS rn
see ya
It will take me longer to do the CS homework because I'm challenging myself to do it in a better way
I'm so proud of myself
it took me a lot of time but I did it fast


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m proud of you too ‎<This message was edited>
Bet it’s very clever
Bruno Dumont: Not that much


Pretty Girl 🐦: An interesting questions asked in frosh I wanna ask you ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I just didn't had experience with it
so it was full of little mistakes
send it


Pretty Girl 🐦: We had a short debate
So let’s say a genie tells you your last happy memory…and you experience it at 45 years old
This means the rest of your life will no longer have happy memories.
What are you gonna do
Bruno Dumont: I don't know
it depends on how you define it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Define happiness?
Bruno Dumont: not having hapiness
I will have like overall more sadness but still have happiness or not happiness at all


Pretty Girl 🐦: It means you won’t feel happy. You’ll feel any emotion but happiness
Bruno Dumont: it there was no happiness at all I would just kill myself


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha me too
Bruno Dumont: if I could still be happy but more sad then happy I would try continuing living


Pretty Girl 🐦: But this dude was like imma live my whole life cuz living is cool
Bruno Dumont: because I will have a lot of time to be dead after so if I can squeeze out the happiness before dying even if I take a lot of sadness could still be worth it
he's just a fucking moron who don't understand how though experiments work


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah makes sense
Haha just because y’all don’t agree doesn’t mean he’s stupid
I just can’t see his logic
Bruno Dumont: the argument he gave is idiotic
I'm going to live cuz living is cool = I'm going to live cuz it gives me hapiness
but we suppose living don't give you hapiness
but that's a contradiction that emerges from supposing he had a argument that makes sense
so that concludes our proof by contradiction that he is a fucking moron


Pretty Girl 🐦: In his mind, cool =\= happiness
He can think existing is cool and miserable at the same time…I think? ‎<This message was edited>
I just don’t agree
This proposition is without bases lol
Now he’s trying to lift a tree 😂😂
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: I'm so fucking happy
I managed to finish the code
and it runs fast


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nice nice

Bruno Dumont: Waiting for u
Yo

Bruno Dumont: In the end my code was working out

Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I’m glad you figured it out
Wouldn’t you agree that the python logo is so cute
Bruno Dumont: ur cuter


Pretty Girl 🐦: Talvez

Bruno Dumont: no actually


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think my python teacher is cuter tho
Bruno Dumont: It's a hard word and u got it right


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooo now you are just antagonizing me

And I refused
Cuz small chance it will fall again
Well I knocked my phone off my bed in my sleep again
And didn’t hear my alarm 🙄
So maybe your idea is not so bad
I will kindly give you a treat (food?) for your brilliant idea…be prepared
Bruno Dumont: Omg I’m scared

Michael got a sparkling water machine thing ‎<This message was edited>
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Good think
Now you can borrow Michael’s machine
And have as much sparkling water as you want
And be very happy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll maybe, I prefer the dh sparking water
The caffeine is hitting me…hard
Bruno Dumont: You shouldn’t drink coffee past 2pm


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I shouldn’t have done this
My head feels like it’s gonna pop
And I only took 2 sips
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry puppy
To pretty girl where are u?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Getting food，be right there
Bruno Dumont: https://youtube.com/shorts/3ipFdRfFvK4?si=9eCpO-N1nQAP7JDv


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, ghoti
Peixe
Bruno Dumont: Good
Peixe is a hard word to spell


Pretty Girl 🐦: And not easy to say either
Bruno Dumont: Cause the x sound
Can be made by ch as well
So you can’t tell just by the sound if it is x or ch
You need to remember


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow, imagine being able to rely on the sound to know the spelling
Bruno Dumont: In Portuguese you can most of the time


Pretty Girl 🐦: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cy_SqZ8AS84/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Bruno Dumont: I feel from my bike
It’s hurting
I was very very lucky I was wearing a jacket that protected me a lot
And my jeans
I scratched my arm
And my knee
And my thumb is hurting


Pretty Girl 🐦: are you bleeding or did you sprain anything?
hug hug
Bruno Dumont: My finger is sprain
I don’t think it broke


Pretty Girl 🐦: Did you just fall? Do you need help right now
Bruno Dumont: My knee and arm are almost bleeding
But it was a little superficial
And I’ve put band-aid
I’m just mad at myself because it was such a stupid mistake


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww I wish I could give you a hug rn
What happened?
Bruno Dumont: Stupid mistake


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok, shit happens
I’m just glad you weren’t too hurt
Bruno Dumont: I could have been a lot worse
I think my gloves helped me not fuck my hamd
Cause it is completely fine


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, that was a good purchase
Bruno Dumont: It is hard to focus now
I haven’t got used to the pain
Fuck


Pretty Girl 🐦: Shit man. Do you want medicine or just wait it out
Bruno Dumont: I'm just complaining
I'm enterely fine
Nothing serious
Just disappointed at myself


Pretty Girl 🐦: Self reflection is good, but no need to hold on to bad feelings towards yourself
Bruno Dumont: I'm just mad because I'm feeling pain when I didn't need to
just cause I'm an idiot


Pretty Girl 🐦: I totally get how you feel lol
But you aren’t an idiot
And it’s ok to be an idiot sometimes as well. We aren’t perfect
‎This message was deleted.
How are you feeling?
Bruno Dumont: I'm okay now
Only a slight disconfort
I'm just worries my thumb will hurt in the gym tomorrow


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oof it might. You can just do abs tho right

Bruno Dumont: No

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes

Bruno Dumont: Its only 7:45

And I was like almost crambling down


Pretty Girl 🐦: Which is fine, we all let go of control sometimes ‎<This message was edited>
Yeah definitely get some good rest
Bruno Dumont: Mental rest


Pretty Girl 🐦: I get what you mean
How do you get mental rest?
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know


Pretty Girl 🐦: I usually just take a nap and poof, reset
Would I be helpful or distracting
Bruno Dumont: I need a few days
I think I need to cry
That’s what I’m missing
Take care of my emotions


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel that
I invite you to come cry with me
Haha, that sounds so weird
Or talk with your mom. That always works for me
Do you wanna talk to me about how you are feeling later?
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: If you want to hear

Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I’m just teasing you
Bruno Dumont: I came back to branner to discuss some questions

Pretty Girl 🐦: Love that feeling
‎sticker omitted
It’s so beautiful outside today
Bruno Dumont: I just spend the day at my bed
Today I wanna work at your riddle then


Pretty Girl 🐦: Looking forward to solving it :]
Bruno Dumont: How hard u want?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Depends on what kinda of puzzles ‎<This message was edited>
If it’s gonna be mathematical, then easy. If it’s enigma riddles, then medium.
Bruno Dumont: Not math
I’m going to make them a little hard
But progressing in difficulty
And provide you tips


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is there an additional prize incentive? 👀
or at least some food?
Bruno Dumont: You will have a price
If you solve the riddle


Pretty Girl 🐦: Can it be cuddling time
Bruno Dumont: no


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😢
Bruno Dumont: there will be no additional rewards besides the answer of the riddle itself
all the rewards are contained in it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh interesting
Im now more intrigued
Im such a dumbass 😂.
I was about to take a nap, and I though, oh let me do a load of laundry first, the timing will work perfectly
So I wash my blanket and pillow cover.
And now I’m in my room, and I can’t sleep on my bed
Foresight 100
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Just finished part 1 and 2 of the riddle
It’s a 3 part riddle
All the parts can be solved individually
And to finish the riddle you need to combine the answers of the 3 parts
I tried ramping up the challenge as the levels go by


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo I’m excited to try your riddles. No idea what they’ll look like
Bruno Dumont: Shaterring your expectations again
I think it maybe a little to hard
Cause I’m doing based on what I would like


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha underestimating me?
Bruno Dumont: But I’ll give you hints if u need
Ok ok
I’m gonna make part 3 painfully hard


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I ain’t scared
Full confidence
Bruno Dumont: I’ll finish it today


Pretty Girl 🐦: Speaking of puzzles
I’m looking at the past puzzle hunt questions. They are not easy
Bruno Dumont: Lol ur tryharding it


Pretty Girl 🐦: https://sumo.stanford.edu/puzzlehunt/2019.html
Lol I googled it and this popped up
Bruno Dumont: Let’s just have fun
Mine will be easy after this ones
But I think my prize is better


Pretty Girl 🐦: https://sumo.stanford.edu/pdfs/puzzlehunt/2019/6_solution.pdf
Question bout consolations, perhaps you’ll be useful after all /j
👀👀
Bruno Dumont: Omg it is so hard
But you said coding is useless
The first problem here could be solved used a code to find the words in the grid
I could code this in 20 min


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey, I was just joking.
But I could find the words in 10
🐸
Bruno Dumont: If you knew the words


Pretty Girl 🐦: L
Bruno Dumont: My code could brute force and find all words in the English alphabet
That are in the grid


Pretty Girl 🐦: Crosswords aren’t that hard
You just look at it
And see it
Bruno Dumont: And if it were 20 times bigger?
It would still take me 20 minutes to code


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
👀
Hey you were the one to challenge the idea that coding is “useless” for the puzzles ‎<This message was edited>
Still holds to not be that useful in this circumstance
Bruno Dumont: I've finished my riddle


Pretty Girl 🐦: damn you put some time into this!
Bruno Dumont: yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sure it’ll be a great puzzle
Bruno Dumont: just tell me when you want to try it
I want to be next to you while you are trying
specially at the end
I want to see your reaction


Pretty Girl 🐦: Now I’m a bit scared
Lemme think. Should I do it tonight
Bruno Dumont: it is a good reaction
but I *NEED* to be with you


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
How’s your roommate? Is he busy tonight?
Bruno Dumont: We can do it in a common area aw

Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh man ok
Bruno Dumont: are you not interested in doing it?
You will understand me after you finish


Pretty Girl 🐦: Of course not. I’m excited to try
Let’s do the riddle tonight then?

‎image omitted
Not sure who this is but sounds cute af
Bruno Dumont: good think
this is very smart
like if you had a crush on me and didn't want to tell just fucking put your name into it
it's good for fucking pussies who don't have the courage to ask someone out


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂 I feel so called out
But it’s also kinda sad. Imagine you input 5 crushes and recieve nothing back
Like 😢, why did I even try
Bruno Dumont: it doesnt mean they dont like you back
maybe they just don't want to use the sweb


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, but that’s how you would feel
at least how I would
Cuz my brain isn’t very rational
Bruno Dumont: I still liked the idea though


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah me too
The survey design also looks nice
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg that’s so cute
I’m gonna figure out how to do this
And include it in all my emails
Also I wanna show you something I found on my Spotify

Bruno Dumont: Going to my CS class
My ginormous code worked almost first try


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm hope it’s not too boring today
Bruno Dumont: It would work first try if it weren’t for Stanford libraries that don’t allow me to do shady stuff
I’m so relieved by this
Debugging this code would be the definition of pain


Pretty Girl 🐦: What shady stuff
Bruno Dumont: Acessing elements outside the array length
But only in the cases I knew I could without fucking up my code
But I guess they put this in so you don’t do it by accident and fuck up your code


Pretty Girl 🐦: Makes sense
I wish you were here
so you could explain array length to me. Definitely not for any other purpose

Pretty Girl 🐦: It really isn’t. Arrilaga and stern are not on the same level

Vai ouvir só uma “virou o dicionário aurelio agora o caralho”


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruno está ululat ‎<This message was edited>
Idk how to conjugate hahaha
Bruno Dumont: I'm saying like try to communicate with someone using this word
they will think you are just saying randrom sounds
random*


Pretty Girl 🐦: What does this mean?
Bruno Dumont: Bruno esta ululando*


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like when you say daltonic and laic
Bruno Dumont: people are going to say "are u fucking aurelium dictionary now?"
but in my case I'm cool and in your case u are strange


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck why is this true
Bruno Dumont: cause I'm cool and u are strang


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg yeah it’s a participle. Fuck I need to brush up on grammar ‎<This message was edited>
:(
Bruno Dumont: Dont worry about it to much
Portuguese grammar if fucking hell


Pretty Girl 🐦: I like complex grammar though, as long as it’s predictable
Bruno Dumont: though if you really wanna learn Portuguese is the verb tense is something you should work on
cause it is very strange when you put a verb in a wrong form if it is a simple verb and a simple form


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: other grammar mistakes are easily overlooked but this one it really makes you sound strange


Pretty Girl 🐦: foda
Bruno Dumont: o sistema e foda parceiro
like punctuations there are times I dont want to switch my keybord to portuguese
so the sentence that should be like
minha família é grande tenho: avôs, avós, mães e tios
turns into
minha familia e grande tenho: avos, avos, maes e tios
but that is fine
but if you say "eu vai ali e volta logo" sounds strange af


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why? It is the punctuation or verb tense? I cannot tell
I’ll come join you for dinner, just lemme know where
Bruno Dumont: Stern


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey bunbun, are ya getting food?

‎image omitted

Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok. I felt that was what you were feeling
Bruno Dumont: I really did not wanted to lose that one

Bruno Dumont: Maybe
I think I was feeling dumb


Pretty Girl 🐦: And maybe it’s not time for my crazy psychoanalysis
Bruno Dumont: I just didn’t want to lose to you at chess I’m not offending you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh I dislike this feeling as well
Bruno Dumont: But I’ve played a hundred times more than you
And losing that so hopelessly just made me feel so dumb


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey, you gave me such a huge head start
Bruno Dumont: I just got stuck in a bad position with just a thread of hope in random checks for hours
It is not true cause I got it back at some point
I completely shit the bad with no excuses


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are a great chess player, one game isn’t gonna change that
Bruno Dumont: I know
I just didn’t want to feel dumb and hopeless again

I was kinda delirious this afternoon because of jet lag
and as I was trying to fall asleep, i said "hug?" out loud
cuz I somehow thought you were with me
Bruno Dumont: I was a bit delusional as well
I woke up 12 hours later
And I was confused
If it was 9:30 am and I slept for like 12 hours
Or if it was 9:30 pm and I fell asleep for 20 minutes
Cause my room has a blackout courtains that makes it impossible to tell apart


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha that's a quality curtain
Bruno Dumont: And I felt tired


Pretty Girl 🐦: I'm very jealous of the weather you have
Bruno Dumont: So I had to look at my phone for messages of someone

Bruno Dumont: And I realized my father sent me a good morning text
What u doing now?

Bruno Dumont: We were playing it wrong
The game ends when there are no more cards to draw

Because you can’t just not discard the wrong cards
U need to play fast
Take more risks
But we developed a killer strategy

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm my financial literacy is lacking, so not sure I understand what you are trying to do
Bruno Dumont: In Brazil it’s impossible to invest as a minor
So everything is my mom’s account
I didn’t had time to put this in my name when I was here before college
I need to do this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Gotcha
Ahmm entendi
Bruno Dumont: And put my money on the correct investments

Bruno Dumont: Damn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Common, it was impossible to not
Bruno Dumont: Girl
You horny
I’m happy to hear that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Only for you
Bruno Dumont: Good
I’ll make you more horny then


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: I’ll send you more pics


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are such a tease
But I’m not complaining
Damn, I love my memory. I have an HD copy of both your pics stored in my mind
Bruno Dumont: ‎video omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: I may not remember important things
Bruno Dumont: I have on of you ass in my dick and you looking at me with a horny face


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I remember your hot ass body
Bruno Dumont: That’s little me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg you so freaking cute
Bruno Dumont: ‎video omitted
Also little me
And my family


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww
Bruno Dumont: ‎video omitted
Me as an inspiring musician


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww, standing ovation 👏
Bruno Dumont: Yeah I was hella cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn I wish I could remember my sister’s cute phase
But I think I found her annoying all the way through until 2 years ago
Bruno Dumont: Your sister is still cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah she is
You know what this kid said to me
Bruno Dumont: Youbfind everything annoying to that’s to be expected


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha why is this slightly too true ‎<This message was edited>
The first day I came back, I took a peek at the gym setup in my neighborhood. And then later, I ate lunch and was like “damn I’m still hungry”
And my sister was like “it’s ok, you spent a lot of energy looking at the gym equipment” 😂😂😂
Bruno Dumont: Kkkkkkk
Your sister = 🐐


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, she has a good personality
Bruno Dumont: Now take her to the gym and mop the floor with her


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahah
Bruno Dumont: Show her who’s the real deal


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, I will happily give that title to her in athletics
Bruno Dumont: But I bet I’ll win in a joking/offence competition


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, you have an unfair advantage of dark jokes
Bruno Dumont: Shut the fuck up I’m training you and I don’t accept losers


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahaha
Bruno Dumont: Not only dark jokes
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: The suspense!
Fucking hell that’s so good
Oh my god
It’s artful
And you look so good
and you are holding your dick
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Kkkkkkkk


Pretty Girl 🐦: What a pleasant surprise. I was wondering why the pic wasn’t loading
Hmmm, I’m gonna revisit that pic on your phone when I see you in person
Bruno Dumont: I don’t have it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck
My
Ass
Bruno Dumont: Yes I will


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, lemme just remember it very hard I guess lmao
Bruno Dumont: But did you like it that much?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, I liked the photography, and the fact that it was you
Bruno Dumont: It’s so cute
How you liked it more than the other 2
Just because it was “artistic”


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
Bruno Dumont: I’m so happy about the reaction
It was so cute it made my heart warm


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww, I wish I could give you a hug

Pretty Girl 🐦: ?
Ohhh
I was actually confused at first about what was happening For the Brazil segment 😂
Bruno Dumont: I’m gonna eat now
But I wanna talk to u latter
About something with my mom
I wanna see your opinion on the matter


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, I’m still in bed
Oh alright
Bruno Dumont: We can play as well

You look so hot. The obliques, your lats your abs 🫣
Man I love the placement of the mirrors
Damn thanks for putting so much effort into these pics puppy. I really like ‘em
Bruno Dumont: Any feedback?
I know its important to keep the sexual tension up and I like it as well


Pretty Girl 🐦: Não, these are great
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: If you want more reveal just lmk


Pretty Girl 🐦: Next time ;)

Bruno Dumont: I’m grateful for the comments
It makes me want to send u more
I’m a horny guy
So I never expected to not be the most horny in the relationship


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ha! I do not have to be horny to appreciate your attractiveness. But yes I’m horny for you most of the time
Ask me to tell you bout the 2 physics “lesson” I learned today later ‎<This message was edited>
I recorded myself singing my favorite English song that you shared with me (omg this is high vulnerability right here ><)
‎video omitted
if you liked it, yay, if you cringed, whatever ahhhh
‎image omitted
você dormiu tarde ontem à noite?
Bruno Dumont: Damn girl
Life is so unfair
That reminds me of a saying in Portuguese


Pretty Girl 🐦: What’s up?
Bruno Dumont: Alegria de pobre dura pouco
Poor man happiness has short duration
How the fuck can u send me such a cute video and expect me to watch it only once


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww haha I was worried for a second
I’m glad you liked it
Bruno Dumont: I loved it
And it makes it all the more sweet


Pretty Girl 🐦: I really hesitated about sharing it
Bruno Dumont: When I know that you made yourself vulnerable to me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz I was like oh no what if you think it’s cringe
Bruno Dumont: Cause you trust me
That’s what matters the most


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahhh I’m happy you liked it
Bruno Dumont: And I’m happy you liked my music as well


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: But I still don’t know
What is cuter if it is your video or this reaction
Tough competition


Pretty Girl 🐦: Heheh
i was feeling a bit down this evening
But you always manage to make my days better
Bruno Dumont: I’m learning from u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo
I also took a shower
Bruno Dumont: I don’t believe


Pretty Girl 🐦: Finally 🥲 dear god it was a journey
Bruno Dumont: I don’t believe


Pretty Girl 🐦: …ok I might have a pic for you
Bruno Dumont: You don’t need to send it you don’t want
But I can promise you I will like it


Pretty Girl 🐦: No I took it to send to you
Bruno Dumont: And I won’t judge you


Pretty Girl 🐦: You can pic when you want it
*pick
Bruno Dumont: Now lol
I can open whenever I want


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok one-marshello-guy
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: What?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol, I was referencing the Stanford marshmallow experiment
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo, you might have heard of it though. It’s about delayed gratification. You give a child one marshmllow and say if you wait x minutes, I’ll give you two marshmallows
Bruno Dumont: Ou
I didn’t know it was Stanford


Pretty Girl 🐦: Honestly I didn’t either
I just looked it up
Bruno Dumont: You know I would take the 2 marshmallows


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha
I know you would
Bruno Dumont: I’m actually so superior I would take one eat it and leave the room cause I don’t need 2 I value my time more
I can use that to work and buy 100 marshmallows


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s so cute how you are like “nuh uh, I’m mature~!”
Ok jokes aside
That’s pretty smart
Bruno Dumont: 😳👉👈 I’m so mature Fiona-chan


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
Bruno-san >///<
Bruno Dumont: Omg


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm maybe I should watch some anime
Bruno Dumont: Let me kill my self real fast


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
‎This message was deleted.
I mean
Bruno Dumont: There’s one I’m considering
Do you know full metal alchemist brotherhood?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes, but haven’t watched
Bruno Dumont: It was top 1 on my anime list for like forever
But apparently there’s one new anime that took the post
As top 1


Pretty Girl 🐦: Which one?
Bruno Dumont: Called Frieren
It’s about how an immortal being sees the death of all his friends and family


Pretty Girl 🐦: Huh sounds interesting
Bruno Dumont: There’s one I reccomend
Is about a guy with photographic memory
And how he’s pretending to be a lawyer


Pretty Girl 🐦: damn my vpn quit after hearing this
i had to switch to my computer
Bruno Dumont: Did you download the gamr?


Pretty Girl 🐦: i was gonna talk to you bout this
oh my god it's a bit annoying
hang on, lemme see if I can figure it out with my dad
nvm we are trying my way
Bruno Dumont: What?


Pretty Girl 🐦: can you log into my steam and download the friend pass version onto my game library?
Bruno Dumont: Sure


Pretty Girl 🐦: i'll give you my login
_j3m
Bruno Dumont: But how would that change anything?


Pretty Girl 🐦: 2ichmond
for some reason, I cannot access the steam store on the pc. But i can open my game library and download games to local from there
Bruno Dumont: Ok
I’ll do that


Pretty Girl 🐦: thank you!!
hopefully it works
Bruno Dumont: hey
they send it a code on your email
tell me


Pretty Girl 🐦: G2JCB
Bruno Dumont: See if it worked out
cause because I have the game downloaded it says it is on the library already

Quite poetic haha

Coolest thing I’ve ever seen, also, the music reminds me of outer wilds
Bruno Dumont: Damn girl
That’s amazing
So proud of u
Real genius
You’re learning so fast
The fact that you saw a 69 and realized it makes it less poetic

Pretty Girl 🐦: All I heard was tic toc tic toc
I'm gonna buy stardew valley

Bruno Dumont: I slept well
And you?
Already sleepy?


Pretty Girl 🐦: a little bit
Bruno Dumont: Wanna cuddle?


Pretty Girl 🐦: YES
Bruno Dumont: To bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: fuck yyou
;-;
Bruno Dumont: I just wanted to remind you
That we could very well br cuddling now
But you are way too far


Pretty Girl 🐦: this is so sad. You should do something to make up for your teasing
Bruno Dumont: Anything my dear


Pretty Girl 🐦: like promise me cuddle time
Bruno Dumont: Just ask what you want
And I’ll make it happen
Do you really think I’m not dying to cuddle with u as well?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ok, I want 20 mins of cuddle time, any way I want,
Bruno Dumont: I just can’t promise I won’t fuck you twice before that happens
Ok

yummmmm
hot
Bruno Dumont: It was very hot indeed
I was covered in sweat


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha sure
I know you were sweating from looking at you own hot reflection
Bruno Dumont: You are hot
And I wanna make you swat
Sweat


Pretty Girl 🐦: you do ;
are you busy today with the holidays?
Bruno Dumont: Not rn
But I’ll be at night


Pretty Girl 🐦: mmm I figured. I want to play stardew valley with you sometime
Bruno Dumont: Do you already have it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: bought and downloaded
Bruno Dumont: Ok we have 2 options
You can start a save on your own
And try and figure things out
And then I can enter your save whenever you want
To help u out and see how it goes
Or you can wait for me we create a save where we only play together and you can play on your own on another save
I think the first one might be better because the game is a little slow
And it might be fun for u to experience it on your own


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok I’ll start my own save then
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t had this opportunity
Cause I saw a gameplay of the game before playing it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Can you just join a save? Or do I need to make it a co-op world
Bruno Dumont: I can join a aave
Save


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
The music is so nice
Bruno Dumont: When are u sleeping tonight?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, I was gonna sleep soon, but now I wanna play the game for maybe 10 mins
Bruno Dumont: Ok
But is Christmas lol are u sure you will sleep?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, Christmas is not a big thing here
It’s more of a shopping event
But if Santa were real, I only have one thing I want right now ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: My dick?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Attached to the rest of you yes
I miss being near you
Bruno Dumont: Thank god
Don’t deatch my dick please

Bruno Dumont: Please promise
Or else I won’t trust you to touch him again


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok I promise 🤞
Bruno Dumont: Bitch

Bruno Dumont: Damn

Pretty Girl 🐦: I keep wondering where my heath bar is
I accidentally sold all my wood
I gave the blacksmith a geode and he hated it :(
Bruno Dumont: Can I call u?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m enjoying the game
Sure
Bruno Dumont: ‎Video call, ‎24 min


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m in the dark though
that was so hot, I’m physically horny now ;-;
Bruno Dumont: Sorry I guess
I need to keep u horny
So next time you take a shower
You fucking show me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Maybe I haven’t learned my lesson
You’ll have to do that again
Bruno Dumont: I’ll do it
If you send me a pic
And make me hard
I’ll send you a cool picture


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm, tempting
Bruno Dumont: Maybe even a video


Pretty Girl 🐦: Good night bunbun

I asked my friends about your workout and my workout


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bom dia!
Bruno Dumont: Bom dia
E feliz natal


Pretty Girl 🐦: vrdd ‎<This message was edited>
Merry Christmas!
Bruno Dumont: What’s that?


Pretty Girl 🐦: verdade hahah
Bruno Dumont: It should be vdd


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo pretty useful
Interesting 🤔
Uh oh, inaccuracies. There IS a future tense (marker) in mandarin
Bruno Dumont: I’m exactly like this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh nice, any suggestions? ‎<This message was edited>
Oh your vernacular is not the only thing I’m manipulating 😉
But the way you speak also affects me. It took me months to take “yessir” out of my vocabulary, but because you say it, I want to say it as wellll
Bruno Dumont: Why did you want to take it out?


Pretty Girl 🐦: because it didn’t fit me
It’s like me saying bro
Kinda cringe in my opinion
Bruno Dumont: Well its fine
I think it should be natural
If fits my style
What my friend sayd is this
‎image omitted
‎image omitted
You should train 5 times a week
And I should train 4
You should work out legs twice a week
And split the leg training


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahhhh I see, the words are coming together
Bruno Dumont: So you can do the regular back chest and shoulder
But intercalated with 2 leg workouts


Pretty Girl 🐦: thankyouu
Bruno Dumont: You could do 6 times a week
But only if you eat very well and sleep well


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm, I’ll see
Bruno Dumont: I’m only doing 4 times a week
But I’ll be training hard
And on Saturday I’m doing a calisthenics workout
Cause I want to be good at it as well


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cool cool
I’m so hungry eu não consigo me levantar
Bruno Dumont: Hj é natal
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cutee
You look so happy
Bruno Dumont: I’m not
Just pretending


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh…
Bruno Dumont: Just kidding
But I actually got a little mad
I was playing a cad game against my brother
And he is trash
Like very trash
But he got so lucky and won the first round by pure luck
Really a lot of luck
And just mocked me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: With zero skill


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
Bruno Dumont: And I go so pissed of


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can imagine your face ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I ended up beating him 12-1 and 12-4 after that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha oh bunbun
Bruno Dumont: But the fact that he was mocking me
Out of luck
Damn just took my ming
I know is so childish
But that’s how I am
I can only have fun when I win


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can understand that
Ahh, that’s a tough mindset
Bruno Dumont: Now I’m playing poker
At least this one I will win


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
Bruno Dumont: That’s a double edge sword


Pretty Girl 🐦: Good luck
Bruno Dumont: Cause that’s bad for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I am also the same way
Bruno Dumont: But that’s what makes me win so much


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s just that I can continue (for a little bit) even if I’m not having fun
Bruno Dumont: From connect 4 to ping pong to foosball to poker


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
Bruno Dumont: I continue it from the sheer frustration
But I don’t have fun
I can be casual if I don’t care
But if I feel that I should win
Then I don’t allow myself to lose
Like a big poker game I know the chance of me winning is slim
So I don’t care that much


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey at least you know this about yourself
you know what works for you
Bruno Dumont: Well
I was getting very unlucky
But got a flush


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nice!
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yum yum
You eat more rice than i do
I haven’t had rice since coming back
Bruno Dumont: Brazilian rice
I miss it
Brazil meals consist of rice beans and a protein type
Always


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah the rice looks great
Bruno Dumont: It is much better
Then your shitty rice
I’m sorry but is true


Pretty Girl 🐦: My..shitty…rice?
You wanna say that again :)
Bruno Dumont: Yes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Chinese rice is amazing, I’m just trying to not eat white rice
Bruno Dumont: *YOUR SHITTY RICE*


Pretty Girl 🐦: How did you do that
Bruno Dumont: Chinese rice << Brazilian Rice
You’ll understand when you try it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, I’ll hold you up to that
Bruno Dumont: I would bet my dick on it


Pretty Girl 🐦: if it’s not, we are breaking up
Hahaha
Damn that’s a big wager
Bruno Dumont: Very big
A 35 cm wager


Pretty Girl 🐦: 35! 😂😂
Goddamn
Bruno Dumont: You know is not
I need to mesure it
Add it to the spreadsheet
The body measure spreadsheet


Pretty Girl 🐦: hopefully google sheets can handle such a big number 🙏🙏
Bruno Dumont: Damn
You know hot to flatter me
I’ll reward later
When the situations get hard


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🫣 it’s not even flattery
Bruno Dumont: It is
Even if it were teue
It would still be flattering
Like calling you hot
Is true
Undoubtedly
Just like an axiom or a law of physics
But is still flattering to point it out


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh I see
Wow, I like your logic
And your flattery
Bruno Dumont: I like your ass
And your pussy


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😮
Bruno Dumont: I mean I also like your logic
Sorry it was the autocorrect again


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha what logic
Bruno Dumont: Don’t ask hard questions


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😫😫
Bruno Dumont: I’m not good at thinking


Pretty Girl 🐦: You’re not good at lying
You mean
Bruno Dumont: Specially when half of my brain capacity is thinking about your ass


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
Bruno Dumont: 45% about your pussy
And the last 5% about your boobs
They are small so 5% is enough


Pretty Girl 🐦: I must have a big brain then, cuz it’s constantly thinking about your dick
And your hot ass body
😂😂 oh man
Bruno Dumont: Is not offensive if it true


Pretty Girl 🐦: And you said you were a boobs man ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I like boobs
But the fact that you have no sensitivity on them makes me wanna do other things
There is no point on playing in your boobs if you don’t feel it
It needs to be fun on you as well


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh, that’s actually very considerate of you
im touched
Bruno Dumont: Quite the opposite
I’m not touching
Lol
But I really like how you are horny biut me
You boobs that is that’s the joke


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel the same
Bruno Dumont: Cause usually in relationships is from what I heard a hard time convincing the girl to have sex
But I love how we are always on the same page


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wonder how true that is
Bruno Dumont: I feel like it is
At least the woman has to concede a lot of the time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Who knows, I think I’ll need to see a data set
Hmm maybe there’s a cultural taboo for women to ask for sex
Cuz you know how men who fuck a lot are seen as chads, while women who fuck a lot are called sluts ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Are u saying you are going to fuck around

Bruno Dumont: I think riding is better
Isn’t it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🤨
Bruno Dumont: Riding me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I love biking

Bruno Dumont: Well

Pretty Girl 🐦: :0

Bruno Dumont: We’ll you don’t know me
So how can I cuddle?


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahah
Bruno Dumont: Why are u not feeling great?


Pretty Girl 🐦: doesn't matter. I'm getting my cuddling time with you
I'm just upset for no reason
Bruno Dumont: No reason?


Pretty Girl 🐦: maybe something is wrong but I don't know what yet
but i kinda want to cry haha
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
Just cry
Is good


Pretty Girl 🐦: i just did my eyeliner
Bruno Dumont: Fuck it
Just cry
To your heart’s content


Pretty Girl 🐦: part of it is def body dismorphia
oh well
Bruno Dumont: What’s going on?
Your body is so pretty
Like hella pretty
If I didn’t knew you were chinese
I would guess you’re dad is called Michelangelo ‎<This message was edited>
Because you look like a greek statue


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha that made me smile
Bruno Dumont: Davi is actually the statue


Pretty Girl 🐦: thanks for telling me that
Bruno Dumont: Lol
I really believe that
And from an objective standpoint you really are pretty


Pretty Girl 🐦: I didn't realize how much I was feeling until talking to you about it
Bruno Dumont: What’s the reason behind it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: this is so terrible to say, but I feel like I don't like being home right now
Bruno Dumont: It’s okay
Tell me what happened ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: ah, we should talk bout this later
Bruno Dumont: I’m here for u
Whenever you need me
And I have a feeling you need it now


Pretty Girl 🐦: I really appreciate that bunbun, but it is freaking christmas for you and your fam
Bruno Dumont: Nop
It is listening to you time


Pretty Girl 🐦: and maybe after a bit i'll be fine again
aww
Bruno Dumont: Just tell me
And I’ll listen


Pretty Girl 🐦: I'm just being dramatic...it's like a lot of little things
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: like things have changed so much I'm not prepared
Bruno Dumont: I have time ‎<This message was edited>
Tell me all of them
To make u fell better


Pretty Girl 🐦: cool painting, very japanese
hehe your bicep
well be prepared (and don't worry if you have to go)
Bruno Dumont: I am


Pretty Girl 🐦: 1. I feel so distant from my mom, my dad, and my sister. like i literally barely talk with them, cuz there is just nothing to say....and I feel like I'm wasting my limited time with them.
2. I feel like I look like shit for the past two days. This is completely irrational I believe because I should still look the same as I did
3. I am spending so much money here. Buying shit I need and want. And it makes me feel terrible, it's like the only reason I came back is to use my parents money
4. I told you before that I feel like the living conditions here is a slight downgrade from stanford. I just feel so anxious and guilty about ahhh i don't know
5. related to 4, I feel so useless. I wish I could make money to take some of the burden off
ok rant over
Bruno Dumont: So do you want advice
Or do you just want to tell me and receive a pat in the head?


Pretty Girl 🐦: sure
hope it's not too annoying. I don't do this often lol
Bruno Dumont: I think this is natural for your age I feel like that as well do what you can do and don’t be to harsh on yourself
You look fine you always do but if that bothers you next quarter we are dieting together I’ll help u and you’ll help me
As long as you are not wasting money is fine. If you need and want is okay to buy. Is not your job to earn money now you should focus on studying and earn money later that’s the whole point of university
It is not your fault in any way you know this right? How can that be your fault?
That’s the same as 3 it is not your job
You are just being to harsh on yourself


Pretty Girl 🐦: ah you are making me cry, not in a bad way though
Bruno Dumont: You are doing just fine
Don’t put to much pressure
You are doing enough and you know this
That’s why you are just finding random shit to be harsh on u


Pretty Girl 🐦: i'm trying to do enough, but I should be trying harder but i don't want
Bruno Dumont: You shouldn’t
You are trying hard enough
You are studying on the best university in the world and working hard
You are constantly working out hard
The money and the results will come
Just be patient
Don’t be so harsh
You are doing your best I know this
And your best is good enough
*YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH*


Pretty Girl 🐦: thank you bunbun, you really make me feel better. I think sometimes I just need a rational reminder
Bruno Dumont: And you’re damn hot
Like omg


Pretty Girl 🐦: I'm so glad I have you, so caring
Bruno Dumont: You build this relationship
I’m only so caring cause you treat me the same
You care about me
And you are so lovely you make me care about u
Even though I’m so selfish


Pretty Girl 🐦: awww
Bruno Dumont: So that treatment is just you receiving what u deserve


Pretty Girl 🐦: that's so heartwarming to hear
haha we need to find a better word than selfish
Bruno Dumont: And you know what I’m feeling the same in the sense of being away from my family
The Christmas was just so mid
I think I just remembered the good parts about here
And then I’m experiencing the bad parts rn as well
I know is not my fault
Is just a human mind bias
The past always looks better


Pretty Girl 🐦: mm I can relate to that
Bruno Dumont: Feeling better?


Pretty Girl 🐦: yes, a lot better
Bruno Dumont: What else can I do to make you feel even better?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
by having a good evening and good night of sleep?

Bruno Dumont: What picture?


Pretty Girl 🐦: a normal picture ;)
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Hahah
Bruno Dumont: Lol that’s so cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: But, thank you bunbun. You make me believe in Santa again cuz you are the best gift I have received
Bruno Dumont: Awww
Cute
See
You treat me just as well
If not better


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad you feel that way. I doubt that sometimes cuz idk, I’m not great at helping people when they feel down
But I’m sure I can help you feel better in other ways
Bruno Dumont: You help me when I feel up
And when I feel mid
And when I feel down
But that is not often


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
That’s a good thing! Balanced
Bruno Dumont: I feel horny more often when sad
And you help me a lot with the first one


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel like that’s an understatement
Bruno Dumont: Well you cause the first one so I don’t know if it counts


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahaha
Well at least I take responsibility for it né
Bruno Dumont: Omg
Omg
Omg
That was so cute
You used né
Omg


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe
Bruno Dumont: Omg
Is it really cheap?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It makes sense?
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: According to this website, you can get a round trip for around 1500
Bruno Dumont: What currency?


Pretty Girl 🐦: $
Bruno Dumont: Damn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah..
Wtf that’s atually cheap compared to the other choices 😭

I can’t believe Demetrius found my gift of slimy algae disgusting 😭😭 ‎<This message was edited>
Omg i need to talk to you about this gameeee
NO WAY
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Bom dia
I’ll give u an advice
Play with the game in Portuguese
Is good to get used to the vocab of plants and vegetables
It helped me a lot in learning english


Pretty Girl 🐦: i'll try that
i have a cat now!!
what pet did you pick
Bruno Dumont: Can I call u?


Pretty Girl 🐦: of course
Bruno Dumont: ‎Video call, ‎No answer
“Of course”
Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: hm?
Bruno Dumont: .
‎Video call, ‎12 min
‎Video call, ‎20 min


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I just hope
I made u horny enough
So that you have to masturbate before sleeping
At least once lol
That’s my goal


Pretty Girl 🐦: masturbating without you makes me more horny 😫
Bruno Dumont: Why?
You can’t finish?


Pretty Girl 🐦: when I do come, it's nice for a few minutes then I'm horny again
Bruno Dumont: Just do it again
You just have a lot of horniness inside of u


Pretty Girl 🐦: it's a self perpetuating cycle, the orgasms begin to feel less satisfying
Bruno Dumont: Did you try it lol?


Pretty Girl 🐦: and my orgasms are strange when I do it myself...it's like not a full one
Bruno Dumont: Damn is there anything I can do?


Pretty Girl 🐦: yep
it's not a big deal, it's still good, I just have to wait for the horniness to pass
Bruno Dumont: Well I might have solutions


Pretty Girl 🐦: maybe it's you lol, I want you
Bruno Dumont: But you’ll need to get over your fears first
You can put me on your headphones


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: And let me whisper in your ears
While you do it
Maybe even show you a thing or two
I’m sure that’ll help ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: that sounds good, in theory
Bruno Dumont: I’m sure is good in practice as well
I think is fine on winter break


Pretty Girl 🐦: but I need more time to get over my discomfort about masturbating with someone knowing I'm masterbating
Bruno Dumont: But if we really are apart on summer
We should work to make the relationship sexually engaging even when we are apart


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah that's important
I'll start putting thought towards this
Bruno Dumont: But don’t force yourself too much
I’m fine
I’ll just fuck you hard when I get back


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah I’m _really_ looking forward to that
Bruno Dumont: I’m as well
You know that u are not allowed to let your roommate ruin this right?


Pretty Girl 🐦: fuckkk
i'll text her as soon as I'm in the u.s.
Bruno Dumont: And if she’s back
You need to book the room
For a few hours
Are u tired?


Pretty Girl 🐦: rest assured I will try
I just sent her a text on instagram but I don't think she's active that
yep, it's bed time for me
btw, what pet did you get in sv
Bruno Dumont: I wish it was “bed” time
I don’t remember


Pretty Girl 🐦: . ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I also wish that


Pretty Girl 🐦: :0
Bruno Dumont: It’s such a minor detail
The pet is almost entirely cosmetic


Pretty Girl 🐦: i disagree, I was thinking wow I wish i could have a pet, and boom, cat shows up
it's the best part of my 13 day gameplay so far
Bruno Dumont: You selected your pet on the character selection


Pretty Girl 🐦: yep
Bruno Dumont: So how was it a surprise?


Pretty Girl 🐦: it just said preference, i didn't know i would get to have it as a pet
Bruno Dumont: What did you put as your favorite thing?


Pretty Girl 🐦: don't cringe
Bruno Dumont: Ok
I wont
Just tell me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh i can't take a screen shot
I put you
Bruno Dumont: Of course you did
That’s so cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha
Bruno Dumont: But it’s gonna be interesting lol
You wanna know what is this for?


Pretty Girl 🐦: what
Bruno Dumont: When you consume an item called stardrop
It says that the taste of it reminds you of your favorite thing
So in your case is gonna taste just like me
And because the only part of me you tasted is my cum


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Is gonna taste like my cum
👍


Pretty Girl 🐦: No no, that’s not true
Bruno Dumont: What else?


Pretty Girl 🐦: You have a taste as well
Bruno Dumont: And how is it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s good, other wise I wouldn’t like blowing you
It’s very distinctly you
And when ever I see your dick
Bruno Dumont: Really?


Pretty Girl 🐦: My mind recreate that taste
^Fun fact hah
Bruno Dumont: How do you know is just like all dicks taste?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
that’s a good question
I just assumed everyone had a different taste
Like how everyone smells different
Bruno Dumont: I’ll go around tasting other woman
And I’ll tell u
How it is


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Cute
But I wanna taste
The taste of your kiss


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, I want to kiss you too
Bruno Dumont: Ngl our kisses need some work
Even the regular one we do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm I agree
Bruno Dumont: But is just like any other thing
We can just practice it and get better


Pretty Girl 🐦: I have no idea how though, but I’ll try
Bruno Dumont: I’ll help u
I’m exited for that


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I wish we were talking about this in the dark
Laying on a bed together
Bruno Dumont: If we were


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I can reach over and hold you
Bruno Dumont: We wouldn’t be talking


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha, you know what Harvey says
Business first, sex after
Bruno Dumont: I don’t care


Pretty Girl 🐦: :0
Bruno Dumont: You better find a way to talk with my dick inside of you then


Pretty Girl 🐦: fuck now I’m horny again
Bruno Dumont: Cause that’s were it is going to be


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah no, I’m gonna need to get myself off ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: You’re masturbating?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Eu vou
Bruno Dumont: Damn
That’s making me horny
Knowing you’re masturbating rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: I have to take my pants off
Was that you?
Bruno Dumont: What?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Someone just started an audio call to me
Wtf
Bruno Dumont: No
It was not


Pretty Girl 🐦: So creepy
Bruno Dumont: Welli
If you’re masturbating
And taking your pants off
You know
👀


Pretty Girl 🐦: Eu não entendo
Bruno Dumont: O que?


Pretty Girl 🐦: *eu não sei
Bruno Dumont: It’s up to you
As always
Whatever ur confortabl
But you know my reaction
I would love it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck
Hard decision
You know I won’t be making any sound right
Cuz ain’t no way I’m doing that in my house
Bruno Dumont: It can be a pic
Anything
Just a small step
Into realizing it is okay


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll try, I just wish you were here with me
No promises though
Bruno Dumont: Okay


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Damn
What’s that?


Pretty Girl 🐦: The cat at your doorstep
Bruno Dumont: I need to see it in a moment I can “enjoy”
If you know what I mean


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do hope you enjoy it
Damn, challenging my mental block is not the most comfortable thing to do
I’m might be requesting some extra cuddling time
Advanced cuddling time
Bruno Dumont: It is not
But it is rewarding I’m sure
You’ll get over it I trust you
Now sleep so we can talk tomorrow

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bom dia
Bruno Dumont: Bom dia
Como você ta?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bem, e vc?
Bruno Dumont: Ótimo
Bom pra caralho
Incrível


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn look at the top comment
Aww I’m glad!
Bruno Dumont: I agree more with the response of the top comment
“Bad words” are just words
Is all about communication
I think they provide a way to express yourself on a new level
And something I value a lot that is being playful and funny


Pretty Girl 🐦: Spicy
Bruno Dumont: Of course it all depends on the context
But trying to see yourself as superior because you don’t say curse words is stupid


Pretty Girl 🐦: I forgot spicy food existed, so I ate a pepper and lost hearing for a few minutes
Bruno Dumont: It is not spicy
Is just rice and meat
But bad cooking skills


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha I agree, it’s such a common mentality among older people though
Bruno Dumont: Yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: Are you tired puppy？

Pretty Girl 🐦: You wanna co-op?!!
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg

Pretty Girl 🐦: Vamos porra
Bruno Dumont: ‎Video call, ‎No answer

Pretty Girl 🐦: loll I'm glad you spotted the reason why i took this pic
Bruno Dumont: Who do you think I am
I will always spot your ass
When it is hanging like this


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha that made me laugh
i love the way you say this, it's a very unique phrasing
Bruno Dumont: It is your phrasing
You said that once
And I liked it so much
I incorporated it


Pretty Girl 🐦: oh I remember that!
lmao, but I was talking about my bare ass hanging out if i didn't wear pjs
Bruno Dumont: I’m imagining your bare ass
Whenever I look at it


Pretty Girl 🐦: ok

Bruno Dumont: Yes


Pretty Girl 🐦: this is closer to my reaction😙
Bruno Dumont: Your actual reaction

Pretty Girl 🐦: ok, I'm annoyed because you are not wrong
actually, you are the most correct
you have ever been
Bruno Dumont: I told ya
I’m always right


Pretty Girl 🐦: sure, "always"
Bruno Dumont: You quotation marks don’t invalidate my correctness


Pretty Girl 🐦: i will conceed this time
wait not the right word
Bruno Dumont: But you know what is my reaction?
🫣 (me craving to see that hanging ass)


Pretty Girl 🐦: o que e sua reação?

Bruno Dumont: Qual é sua reação?*
The way you wrote it seems that you don’t know what “reação” means


Pretty Girl 🐦: ohh interesting
i haven't learnt bout this yet
Bruno Dumont: Well I want to point out your attention to this


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha ok, your request is acknowledged.
and I will try to deliver

Bruno Dumont: No


Pretty Girl 🐦: the warms of your back to my chest as I hug you on the bed

Bruno Dumont: Damn girl

Is there anything I can do now?


Pretty Girl 🐦: where are you right now?

Bruno Dumont: ‎Video call, ‎15 min
Well

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey
Proof of shower
Bruno Dumont: For the necessary procedures I might need two copies of it


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Sorry I didn’t see your WeChat text
When I have vpn on, notifications go wacky
Bruno Dumont: Damn girl looking awesome
Really awesome
It’s a pity you covered your tities but it is good enough for me now
I think you lost a bit of belly not going to lie
But really I missed seeing you naked
Thank you so much for that


Pretty Girl 🐦: covered lmaoo
i have one titty covered
me fucking too
Bruno Dumont: I need to see every square inch of your body
Cause it is all incredible


Pretty Girl 🐦: maybe, might just be the lighting
I'm glad you think so. I needed to hear that
Bruno Dumont: Babe I don’t think lighting can burn fat
It is not that easy


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha
Bruno Dumont: Actually
I was talking with the higher ups
I might need 3 copies of it
For all the burocratics procedures
It is not up to me
I hope u can help me with that


Pretty Girl 🐦: hmm, I think i'll need to consult my legal team
Bruno Dumont: I really with I didn’t need this but is the higher ups
You try that
But when you tell them that you are going up agains Harvey Specter


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahha omg
Bruno Dumont: You will watch the color drain out of their faces


Pretty Girl 🐦: i remember this scene
very badass
Bruno Dumont: Or you can take my deal now


Pretty Girl 🐦: do you actually want another view?
Bruno Dumont: 3 copies
Or course I want

Bruno Dumont: I loved it
And I wanna see your picture ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🫣
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Damn I’m so lucky
Do you feel like this time off made you value the relationship more?


Pretty Girl 🐦: yes, I think it made me more grateful of having you be a part of my life
Bruno Dumont: I think it made me realize I like you more than I imagined


Pretty Girl 🐦: because, idk, more time to refect on how you have helped me, made me happier, made me laugh
Bruno Dumont: Because I didn’t though I would miss you that much
I mean is been 2 weeks
And I called you everyday


Pretty Girl 🐦: I knew I would miss you. But i didn't know it would feel like this...because it's not a empty feeling, it's more of a overflowing feeling of "I want to shower you with care but I'm limited by physical space"
good thing we feel the same ;)
I like you so damn much
I've literally turned into a cringe poet
i thought the sunset looked beautiful and thought of you
I thought the moon veiled by the clouds looked so lovely and thought of you
Bruno Dumont: Just be careful not to like me too much


Pretty Girl 🐦: what happens if i like you too much?
Bruno Dumont: It can be bad
I want to have a happy and healthy relationship


Pretty Girl 🐦: everything in excess is bad
that's why you only get 2 copies
Bruno Dumont: Ok you’re just being mean at this point ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: ahh that's what I strive for too. Don't worry. I'm a rational person
Bruno Dumont: I’m more hahaha loser 🤪

Bruno Dumont: You admited it
You started it


Pretty Girl 🐦: nuhuh
you started it
Bruno Dumont: Where?


Pretty Girl 🐦: uhh
Bruno Dumont: Actually you started it
By liking me first during ISO
And “confessing your feelings” during NSO just like a cringe and strange person
Huge blunder ‎<This message was edited>
??


Pretty Girl 🐦: but I still won the game at the end
Bruno Dumont: Noo


Pretty Girl 🐦: or at least
moved to a higher level
Bruno Dumont: You saw kaguya sama
The one that confesses loses
And is forever traped by the other


Pretty Girl 🐦: well they are fucking immature betas
Bruno Dumont: Just like u


Pretty Girl 🐦: I'm an immature sigma
Bruno Dumont: Remember how fucking beta you were in the beginning?


Pretty Girl 🐦: theres a difference
Bruno Dumont: No chemistry at all


Pretty Girl 🐦: nope
Bruno Dumont: I made my moves and you stood there like a door
I don’t know what I had in my mind
To stick to you even after you broke up with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: ...cute door at least?
Bruno Dumont: aDOORable


Pretty Girl 🐦: nooooo
omg lmaoo
i can't believe i set that up for you
Bruno Dumont: You did
It was the most perfect joke set up of my life


Pretty Girl 🐦: that's a good one though
hahaha
Bruno Dumont: The easiest punch I ever threw


Pretty Girl 🐦: I'm in a good mood right now. Perfect for a restful sleep
Bruno Dumont: Godd

Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow beautiful pictures
Now I want to go to the mountains in china
I dream of of you
And didn’t want to wake up.  But my alarm clock rang and I was like why are you not turning that off and just looking at me ‎<This message was edited>
Then I realized oh, dreaming
Bruno Dumont: Damn

Curtindo um hanabi com os amigos


Pretty Girl 🐦: fun!!
I'm just playing stardew valley in my room
wait it's like 1 am for you
Bruno Dumont: Yup
I’m going up to 3
Maybe 6


Pretty Girl 🐦: damnn
worth it though, maybe
Bruno Dumont: We just played hanabi on a whole new level
We managed to give someone 2 tips without giving them a tip
Like a giv a tip to you and I can tell John the color and number os his card with this tip


Pretty Girl 🐦: ooo tell me in more detail later
Bruno Dumont: It’s called finess
Is when you purposely give someone a bad tip
And the fact that you gave someone a bad tip
Makes other players realize that they have to do something to make the tip actually good


Pretty Girl 🐦: ok, kinda makes sense
fuck yessss, in your face Abigail
i got 11 freaking eggs
...after 3 tries
Bruno Dumont: Don’t be mean to my wife


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahaha
well your wife
just fucking lost
to me
Bruno Dumont: I like here more than I like you
You’re just my girlfriend


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😫
Bruno Dumont: She’s the mother of my 2 children


Pretty Girl 🐦: lmaooo can't argue with that logic
Bruno Dumont: Yup you can’t
‎image omitted
But having fun


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg your eyes are kinda red
still hot
Bruno Dumont: I’ve tried weed for the first time
But only a little bit
I didn’t thought my eyes would get red


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah sure
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know what I’m gonna do


Pretty Girl 🐦: you get it from your buddy mike ross?
Bruno Dumont: Cause I don’t my mom finding out


Pretty Girl 🐦: just say
you've been doing cocaine
then she won't know you are doing weed
omg my little cat is sleeping on my bed, it's so cute
Bruno Dumont: I’m being serious


Pretty Girl 🐦: as serious as I am
Bruno Dumont: Ok
I’ll stop trying to convince you I did weed
I could if it were on person


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah probably haha
Bruno Dumont: But I need all my persuasive skills


Pretty Girl 🐦: you are a very persuasive person
or maybe I'm just into you
who knows
Bruno Dumont: I think it’s both
Just playing some poker
But I just can’t think rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: aww try to just relax and enjoy chaos

Bruno Dumont: Gostou?


Pretty Girl 🐦: gostei
Bruno Dumont: So

I have very mixed feelings about it
I liked it a bit
But I know is trash and I hate it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh? 👀
O que é?
Bruno Dumont: Well

But I feel like os going to be best if we make this together
Team effort
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: OMGGG

Bruno Dumont: Did you like it?
Cause it is so trash


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah!!
Bruno Dumont: Is just a bunch of things randomly thrown at it
It looks so not well done


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well it’s kawaii AF and nothing cute is trash
Bruno Dumont: I told you I was going to put suits on it
Look at the tie on the chicken
And in the cat


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omghahahha

Pretty Girl 🐦: Mushrooms

Pretty Girl 🐦: Kinda a hard questions. I like many things but they are very random
Bruno Dumont: There’s 2 random chess pieces a ping pong racket and a pixel art chicken with a tie

Bruno Dumont: I actually wanna kill myself


Pretty Girl 🐦: Have you started the calisthenics?
Bruno Dumont: I’ve been slacking off so kuch

Pretty Girl 🐦: bom dia

Pretty Girl 🐦: I messed around with the stereograph, started reading this book that's might be inspiring
did some duolingo because I wanted to switch things up
uhh, skipped the gym cuz my knees hurttt
and laid in my bed missing you ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Stereograph?


Pretty Girl 🐦: it's what's in this thing
and the crazy looking image
I really like them, played them a lot as a kid
Bruno Dumont: Cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: have you done them before?
Bruno Dumont: Wanna play stardew valley?

Bruno Dumont: I’m going to discord


Pretty Girl 🐦: give me a sec
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: o que vc esta fazendo?
Bruno Dumont: Nada

acabei de falar com ele


Pretty Girl 🐦: legal
Eu vou terminar meu pt capitulo do dia, entao eu...can regulate my emotions
Bruno Dumont: regulate your emotions?

Pretty Girl 🐦: estou um pouco triste, mas ja estou me sentindo melhor
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: eu me imagino te comendo sempre que eu fecho os olhos


Pretty Girl 🐦: que?? nao entendo at all
Bruno Dumont: I imagine myself fucking you every time I close my eyes


Pretty Girl 🐦: ohhhh
omg
I was confused hahaha and trying to study your sentence like a nerd
sinto saudade hoje
oh wanna see something
Bruno Dumont: sim


Pretty Girl 🐦: wait, can you help me say this in pt first?
Bruno Dumont: say it and I'll correct it


Pretty Girl 🐦: "voce quer ver something?"
i like your approach ;) thank you
Bruno Dumont: quer ver uma coisa (legal)
usually people say with legal at the end like wanna see something cool but I guess you can say quer ver uma coisa?
the literal translation would be like wanna see one thing


Pretty Girl 🐦: gotcha, very cool
i'm going to share a pic of the mona lisa ‎<This message was edited>
was at the louvre today
Bruno Dumont: damn
vamo porra
vamo caralho
favela venceu porra
os meno ta no topo


Pretty Girl 🐦: woah woah, what are the last two
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: favela venceu = favela won = is like an expression to say when you suceed
is usually used by lower income people that came from the favela and "won" in life
but can be used just a funny expression
the same goes for the next one


Pretty Girl 🐦: ah entendo
makes no sense though ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: meno = informal way of refering to your group
ta = esta = is
no topo = on top
we are on top


Pretty Girl 🐦: ohhh
forgot about the contractions
Bruno Dumont: e foda
o sistema e foda parceiro
a sociedade ela nao perdoa uma

Pretty Girl 🐦: nao entendo
Bruno Dumont: por isso

Pretty Girl 🐦: de cum haha
Bruno Dumont: o porra


Pretty Girl 🐦: wait sorry i still don't get it
eu vou falar muito isso
Bruno Dumont: it's fine lol
all those sentences are just random complaints
it like society sucs man
life is hard
or wathever
is just a funny way to say nothing in particular
is like
"Oh my father died in a car accident


Pretty Girl 🐦: meu pai acabou de me dar sun flower seed
omg i was typing that before you said that
now i sound like an ass hole
Bruno Dumont: why lol/
My father didn't die


Pretty Girl 🐦: idk, i wouldn't say that even if it's fictional
but the seeds are goooooood

shaved 😂😂
Bruno Dumont: ??


Pretty Girl 🐦: the "logic" puzzle
Bruno Dumont: Shaved?
I’m confused


Pretty Girl 🐦: the narrator said they were kidnapped, woke up, and had been "wiped of all belongings, shaved, memory wiped, and handcuffed"
Bruno Dumont: Ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: i just thought that was a funny thing to do
Bruno Dumont: Now I get it

Bruno Dumont: I like


Pretty Girl 🐦: Vc vê seus freaking músculos? ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: No
That’s not allowed
You are allowed to do the opposite
Speak in English and curse in Portuguese
But it personally offends me
You speaking Portuguese
The best cursing language ever


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahha
Bruno Dumont: And cursing in English


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well my textbook doesn’t teach that unfortunately
Bruno Dumont: I teach
Vc ve a porra dos músculos?
Vc ve a caralha dos seus muculos?
Vc ve a merda dos seus músculos caralho?


Pretty Girl 🐦: O que é “dos”
Bruno Dumont: O seu merda olha pra porra dos seus musculos nessa caralha
It’s the possesive


Pretty Girl 🐦: This one is a bit complicated to understand
Bruno Dumont: Casa dos meus amigos = my friends’ house
You shit look to the cum os your mussels in this dick


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh I see! Olha is a verb!! I thought it was a noun
Btw my lovely bunbun,

Pretty Girl 🐦: verb conj?
Bruno Dumont: Can’t wait suck your dick


Pretty Girl 🐦: ahh

Bruno Dumont: You need to say can’t wait to suck your dick
Try correcting it yourself


Pretty Girl 🐦: para?
Bruno Dumont: Yup
Put it all together


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehehe
não posso esperar para chupar seu pau
Bruno Dumont: Yup
But don’t forget
To sound natural you pra instead of para


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Oh right!
Bruno Dumont: You can even say pa if you want to be really natural


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
Next time I’ll remember that
Bruno Dumont: But I recommend you start with pra
You’ll get more natural with time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thanks for helping me, this is very fun pra mim
Bruno Dumont: De nada porra
Agora chupa meu pau como pagamento


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha

Bruno Dumont: Nice try ‎<This message was edited>
But we don’t say the verb is
We say the verb go


Pretty Girl 🐦: what?? can you say it for me
Bruno Dumont: Quando vc vai dormir?


Pretty Girl 🐦: :( when do i use which? i just learned this
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Where?


Pretty Girl 🐦: which = ir vs estar
Bruno Dumont: Sleep is always ir
The whole points is the correct way is
Are you going to sleep?
So whenever you would say it like this you use ir that means go


Pretty Girl 🐦: gotcha
Bruno Dumont: So when are u eating is actually when are u going to eat
So you need to say “quando vc vai comer?”
But if you wanna say are u eating now?
You don’t say go
So you use
“Você está comendo agora?”


Pretty Girl 🐦: ohh i see. what about "are you sleeping now"
Bruno Dumont: Try it


Pretty Girl 🐦: vc esta dormindo agora
Bruno Dumont: Não estou não né porra
Como eu ia eu falar com vc se eu estivesse dormindo?
Correct

Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha
what are the contractions?
Bruno Dumont: C = vc = você


Pretty Girl 🐦: entendo
Bruno Dumont: You can use a single n
But I like using two
Is just personal preference


Pretty Girl 🐦: so you like a pair of "n"s?
Bruno Dumont: Yup
‎audio omitted
I’m sorry but this is wrong
Chupar meu pau c não quer nn?
Now is correct


Pretty Girl 🐦: então chupe deez nuts
why?
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
It just is
There are things in life there’s no explanation
Did u realize I’m slowly sending you more stuff in portuguese
Just you wait untill you can understand a youtube video
I’m going to flood you with them
I’ll show you the king of irony


Pretty Girl 🐦: oh you are doing that on purpose? that's so thoughtful, i was literally gonna say that these reels are very helpful for me to learn sentence structures and some vocab
Bruno Dumont: 😉


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg an EMOJI???
I love this novo bruno
Bruno Dumont: A vai se fuder
Não pode fazer nada nessa merda
Que já me criticam
Depois arrumo uma amante e não sabe pq

Bruno Dumont: Not translating that lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: ok :(

Boa noite
I’m gonna tell you something because it’s weighing on my mind. My mom just asked me to flex my bicep (lol ok), said looks good (thanks), then told me “ok you can start losing weight now.”
So I was like, don’t say it like that cuz that hurts my feelings. She mocked what I said and started laughing. I left her room and she was still laughing omg.
I found this interaction so absurd and upsetting that I started laughing

amo muito foda isso, thank you for making it for me bunbun
(Did I use the right pronoun? And can I say “obrigada pra fazer pra mim?”) ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Damn girl stop
Please
You know I can’t afford to do to shangai en
Rn
Don’t do that to my little heart


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha I was slightly worried that you might not like it
but now i am not
Bruno Dumont: It was on purpose


Pretty Girl 🐦: what do you mean?
Bruno Dumont: I sent
This
Than this


Pretty Girl 🐦: gotcha
Bruno Dumont: To make your heart stop for a second


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha
Bruno Dumont: Now stop working oit


Pretty Girl 🐦: I'm fishing in stardew valley rn
Bruno Dumont: Cause u are getting stronger than me


Pretty Girl 🐦: working those arms even in a video game
Bruno Dumont: I’m so happy for u
I told you when the biceps pop out
You will feel proud


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol, you are right
have to admit
Bruno Dumont: I told u
It was the same for me
I was like I don’t care about building muscles
I love myself how I am
When the bicep popes out
I started to flex on car windows


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahaha
Bruno Dumont: It’s just unavoidable


Pretty Girl 🐦: i'm trying to catch this crazy ass fish
it moves like a mad man, i lose it every time
Bruno Dumont: Where are u fishing?


Pretty Girl 🐦: river in the rain
Bruno Dumont: Oh


Pretty Girl 🐦: yes i did a little research ;)
Bruno Dumont: It’s catfish


Pretty Girl 🐦: yummy
Bruno Dumont: You know that fish has personality?


Pretty Girl 🐦: gatinha peixe
Bruno Dumont: They can be sinker, floaters, dart or mixed maybe I’m forgetting one


Pretty Girl 🐦: woah
Bruno Dumont: If it is sinker then it wants to drop down more than go up


Pretty Girl 🐦: well the two i met were darters
Bruno Dumont: So you should keep in on the top of the green bar so when it drop down you can catch it more easily
All of the super hard fish are mixed
But if it is really hard you can buy a better fishing rod


Pretty Girl 🐦: fuck i just lost another one 😫
it's actually impossible
Bruno Dumont: Better rods allow you to put bait so you can catch more fish
And buy a modifier willy sells one that makes the progress bar fall more slowly when the fish get out
It is the perfect for this moment
It is well worth the investment to buy the iridium rod if you have the money


Pretty Girl 🐦: ok i def need that..cuz i just lost another one
no fucking way, sebastian is asking for cat fish
Bruno Dumont: What a son of bitch
Hey
Can I call u?
For a bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: yes!
Bruno Dumont: ‎Video call, ‎No answer

Pretty Girl 🐦: Fascinating
Bruno Dumont: Hey
My grandma was like
Please tell Fiona that I’m not that ugly
I look better in real life than in those close call videos
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahhaha doesn’t everyone. But you know what I realized
In situations like this, most people are too anxious on how they themselves look than to focus on how I look
But she looks great in the video
Idk what she is talking about
Bruno Dumont: Too bad for them you looked amazing


Pretty Girl 🐦: awww
That made me happy
Bruno Dumont: It is true
Well I was 100% focused on how you looked amazinf
Cause you already saw me at my worse and still liked me
So I don’t even give a shit anymore


Pretty Girl 🐦: When was your worst Lmaoo
I legit think you always look great
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: (Except when you have your annoyed face)
O my
Bruno Dumont: I’m gonna give you one of those


Pretty Girl 🐦: Alright
Bruno Dumont: The first one
What do you think?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sure!
Man it’s still a bit hard to see myself in photos
This is pro Brazil propaganda…because you made fun of my pt accent once 🫣
Haha I saw this one a lot of ago and it still made me chuckle
Bruno Dumont: Wanna do this
?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was researching bilingual parenting technique when I was 10 cuz i wanted to try on my sister
Bruno Dumont: Lol that’s so cute
I wanna try on my child
I wanna make him so overpowerd
People will think he’s a bug
He’s gonna grow up smart, healthy, mentally healthy, social and mature
And happy as hell


Pretty Girl 🐦: well I do hope that comes true
Bruno Dumont: Have I failed before?
I don’t think so


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh man haha
Bruno Dumont: I’m gonna research the hell out of this
During 9 months I’m gonna make my number 1 priority to learn everything there is to know about parenting
Then I’m gonna come up with a plan
I’m gonna have specialist to help me
Take feedback
And improve
I’m going to go to a psychologist just to talk about parenting


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well if I ever have a kid, my goal would be to train them with the skills to self-regulate themselves into an intelligent and empathetic person
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: Both to themselves and other people
Bruno Dumont: I think that’s the meta
Cause it’s impossible to ser everything they are doing
So the only viable option is to trust them


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah
Bruno Dumont: So you need to make him smart and mature
So you can trust he’s taking the right decisions
But I wanna shortcut him


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahha
Bruno Dumont: I don’t want him going through the hastle of learning financial education
I’m gonna implant this through his childhood
I don’t want him having to learn the importance of exercise I want to make it as natural to him as taking a shower
Everything that I feel is valuable I want to make him learn it effortlessly
So he can focus his energy in the future in whatever he wants to do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Won’t be easy though, have you ever tried convincing your parents to pick up a habit? I imagine that’s how working with a kid would be, if not worse ‎<This message was edited>
Lol anyways, parenting is hardddd. That’s why so many fuck it up so bad ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: That’s why I will be learning the habit
If I want him to workout I’m gonna workout since he’s 1 year old
Take him with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah but it’s the translation process that’s the challenge
Bruno Dumont: And he’s gonna see this as natural
I’m not saying it’s easy
That’s just the plan
But you create the plan to throw it all away
And create a new one


Pretty Girl 🐦: thats a good mindset
Bruno Dumont: But the fact of the matter is that I’m gonna give it my alk
With my rational and optimal mindset
And I trust myself that this is enough


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe I believe in you
Bruno Dumont: Well
The fact that I care so much about this
And I’m with you
Means that I trust you a lot


Pretty Girl 🐦: Shit, you are right
Bruno Dumont: That’s not me just saying it
You know it is true
Can I call u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
Bruno Dumont: Alone this time I promise

Bruno Dumont: Yo thats fire
Buy Maru a bouquet at pierre and gift it to her
You’ll start dating


Pretty Girl 🐦: i don't want to date anyone in game rn though
seems like a lot of work
Bruno Dumont: It’s not
Is just like in real life


Pretty Girl 🐦: btw, did you get my good morning text reference
Bruno Dumont: You don’t need to give them a lot of attention


Pretty Girl 🐦: who have _you_ been dating?
Bruno Dumont: Just give a gift from time to time
And you’ll be fine


Pretty Girl 🐦: lmao ok
Bruno Dumont: But really
Is the same as not dating
You can even date more than one


Pretty Girl 🐦: quero sua atencao though
Bruno Dumont: Just like real life


Pretty Girl 🐦: alright, I'll give it a go
Bruno Dumont: So
Tell me more
About your day


Pretty Girl 🐦: i went to the gym with my dad, very interesting experience ‎<This message was edited>
it was chest day so I asked him to try my workout instead of just doing cardio
this man, omg
Bruno Dumont: What?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I forget that not everyone is observant
I showed him how i do inclined bench, and he kept holding the weights vertically
I showed him 20lb first, and then he did 25lb
I also do 25lb. but he was like no it's too heavy for you
and I was like no, it's not (like a boss)
Bruno Dumont: Omg you’re so cute
Keep going


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha omg i almost forgot
the first one he did
Bruno Dumont: Did you do with 25 and proved him wrong?


Pretty Girl 🐦: of course, you think your girlfriend is all talk no game?
instead of going elbows down, he freaking opened his chest, and I thought he was gonna rip his freaking sholders
Bruno Dumont: I knew you could do it
I want to know your father’s reaction


Pretty Girl 🐦: uhh i didnt notice cuz i was doing my reps
and then he asked, is it popular for women to work out in the u.s.
Bruno Dumont: Only for smart woman


Pretty Girl 🐦: intersting line of questioning don't you think
Bruno Dumont: That’s why you only worked out after I convinced you and not on your own


Pretty Girl 🐦: oh
my
god😫
Bruno Dumont: I guess it makes sense knowing how your mom reacted
Little does he know resistence training is gold standard for weight loss


Pretty Girl 🐦: hehe, I did mention that to him because he wanted to lose weight
but idk, cardio is more familiar to him, and it's hard to get him to try new things
Bruno Dumont: Yup
And starting to workout is hard
It’s a lot of knew things it hurts and you don’t know how to do the exercises
I told you you were stellar at the beginning


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah
Bruno Dumont: I got super impressed


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahah i am very flattered ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Made me want to fuck you more


Pretty Girl 🐦: why did you think I was so motivated huh
Bruno Dumont: You know why I wanted you to work out right?


Pretty Girl 🐦: why?
Bruno Dumont: So I could spend alone time with you
And show off a bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: well, lets just say I was muito impressed by your strength, physique, and discipline
i had to google how to spell physique
Bruno Dumont: I know I don’t have the first one
The second is almost non-existing
But I’ll grant the third one


Pretty Girl 🐦: bitch you know that aint true
if i say you do, then you do
you don't want to be wrong right?
Bruno Dumont: But if the Chinese beauty startdard is being fucking slim
Then I guess I have a godly physique


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol, for women, idk bout men cuz I'm not a man
maybe I'll ask my guy friends
Bruno Dumont: I think I have a similar physique to k-pop idols I’m just not tall


Pretty Girl 🐦: i'm actually curious now
Bruno Dumont: *NO*
No talking to guys


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahah
hmm, male kpop tends to go a more androgenous aesthetic though
idk, i don't like categorizing looks
Bruno Dumont: I’m talking about the physique
Ot the face
I’m not gay
Nor asian
Nor gay ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg
the politically-correct part of me jumped out for a second ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I know right
I also hate gay
We are so alike


Pretty Girl 🐦: idk bout the physique, they are never shirtless, it's not allowed
they literally starve themselves to be lean ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Betas
I do that
While trying to gain weight


Pretty Girl 🐦: and I do that, but still gain weight
Bruno Dumont: You need to start eating less caloric foods


Pretty Girl 🐦: i think my body has become so energy efficient that I am taking energy from hydrogen in the air
Bruno Dumont: Stuff you can eat a lot
And not gain weight
Like my cum


Pretty Girl 🐦: ok
I _am_ craving a treat right now
bunbun, I might sleep early today pq I can't keep my eyes open
Bruno Dumont: Ok
Wake uo early then so we can talk tomorrow
Good night

Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahaha fuck you are so precise
Bruno Dumont: Yup I am
Don’t try to trick me pretty girl
I’m 2 steps ahead


Pretty Girl 🐦: well, you know who else thought they were 2 steps ahead?

Bruno Dumont: Come on


Pretty Girl 🐦: big. L.
Bruno Dumont: Don’t compare me to louis
And most importantly
Don’t compare yourself to Harvey

Bruno Dumont: But yesterday you were with me showing off on we chat


Pretty Girl 🐦: :0 that was a slip up
because i was too focused on the hot guy
Bruno Dumont: Oh yes
Sure


Pretty Girl 🐦: can we try playing stardew valley again tomorrow? I wanna see if being in the other room makes a difference
Bruno Dumont: My vpn is not working
So it’s not possible


Pretty Girl 🐦: por favor bruno-san
Bruno Dumont: Also we can’t cuddle when I get back
Because my vpn is not working

Because you were messing with me
I can’t have you having all the power in the relationship ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: what power, idk what you are talking about

Bruno Dumont: The only thing you cared bout me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Also, 50% off happy hour wow
Loll
If your hair is brushed when I see you again

Bruno Dumont: It’s not
I’m gonna arrive from a 40 hours flight
There’s no way in hell it’s going to be nice


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahah good
Bruno Dumont: But I might take a shower and brush it before I see you
I’m probably going to arrive smelling like rat shit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Then I’m gonna have so much fun with you
*your hair i mean
Bruno Dumont: I’m going to put your favorite perfume (if I remember)


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😳
Bruno Dumont: I’m going to spray some on my dick


Pretty Girl 🐦: uhhh
Bruno Dumont: Cause I think you’ll be spending a lot of time there


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha

Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww that’s so cute

Bruno Dumont: You don’t need to
You just need to send me a picture of you smiling

Pretty Girl 🐦: ok :]
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
Cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: no u
damn, without gym in my schedule, idk what to do with myself
Bruno Dumont: I went to the gym today


Pretty Girl 🐦: yep i remember your bicep pump
Bruno Dumont: Forgot how good a pump is


Pretty Girl 🐦: the youtube video was interesting
Bruno Dumont: I love bicep pumps


Pretty Girl 🐦: i still don't like pumps
Bruno Dumont: Beta


Pretty Girl 🐦: it's...almost claustrophobic, like i'm restrained by my own body
Bruno Dumont: Nop
Is just simple
Big muscles me like ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1cdsGTuzdW/?igsh=MWg3cWY5enRkejdzbQ==


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg😂
the heck is that rice washing though
oh hey, whenever you have time, can you center the text on the poster for me?
thank you bunbun :]
Maru showed me a binary star system while romantic music played in the background 😭😭
I just got a super cool blue sword!
‎image omitted
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: You know what that is?


Pretty Girl 🐦: yep! I read bout them. Apparently they are very common
Bruno Dumont: What is it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think Sirius is a binary star né
it’s like two stars that orbit each other or something?
And they are really close so people group it as one star?
Bruno Dumont: A common misconception is that planets orbit starts
Everything in a solar system orbits the center of mass ‎<This message was edited>
But starts are so massive that they bring the center os mass very close to their own center
But when you have two very massive stars
The center os mass gets outside the star
And it looks like they are dancing with each other


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cute
Bruno Dumont: A cool think about those is that you can discover a bunch of things about them with just their light


Pretty Girl 🐦: A perpétual dance
Bruno Dumont: If you measure the intensity and frequency of their light through a full “year” aka a full rotation of both
You can compute how far they are how massive they are and how big they are
With calculations I used to know how to do


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll just stick with observing them
Having tea time with my fam right now
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: This is why I’m not losing weight
I was like I’m gonna drink tea
My mom said she’ll buy some tea snacks

I have the feeling 2024 might be the best year of my life


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah?
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: pq?
Bruno Dumont: I fell like everything in my life is under my control
I have a clear understanding of what makes me sad and happy
And I think I can handle things
The environment I’ll have this year is a wonderful fit for what I want in my life
And I can see a clear path to progress in most of the relevant aspects I want to work on


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s a great feeling, I’m happy you feel this way
Damnn, living the dream!
Bruno Dumont: And it’s not like a crazy New Year’s resolution
Like I’m going to change my whole life
I’m just gonna keep going in the same pace I am now
And fell like that’s good enough to make it the best year


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s the best kinda of goals
Bruno Dumont: I have goals
But this is not it
It’s just a realization


Pretty Girl 🐦: hmm
Bruno Dumont: That more likely than not the year is going to be greT

He’s the real G
Fun fact uterus is a he in Portuguese


Pretty Girl 🐦: fascinating
Bruno Dumont: There’s even words for pussy that are he


Pretty Girl 🐦: at this point, why make nouns gendered
it would make my life a lot easier
like why is "dia" masc
Bruno Dumont: And that’s a mistake no one makes


Pretty Girl 🐦: except me
Bruno Dumont: Even people that has very trash Portuguese


Pretty Girl 🐦: i'm so special
Bruno Dumont: So if you get it wrong everybody will see
I’m talking bout natives
For people whose native language don’t has gender is actually fucking hard


Pretty Girl 🐦: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1aiXm9Pa5Q/?igsh=c3R6cDgxYTBxM3I2
Bruno Dumont: It’s the number 1 mistake every gringo makes
I predicted that one bitch


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1Z1_o9uone/?igsh=d3V3enU0MXA2OXJ6


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol
Bruno Dumont: What u up to?
To start your year


Pretty Girl 🐦: might go out to have breakfast
but rn I'm just trying to get out of bed
what are you doing? are you staying up
Bruno Dumont: Of course


Pretty Girl 🐦: what does your fam do in the mean time?
Bruno Dumont: My mom is crying here


Pretty Girl 🐦: my sister kept complaining that tea time and talking was boring
what why🥺
Bruno Dumont: Cause I’m going home already
Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: awwwwww
Bruno Dumont: I fell her


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah you know why
cuz she wanted to use her ipad
Bruno Dumont: When I visit your family we are watching youtube together while you are boring alone


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahhahahah
i was having a great time
Bruno Dumont: My brother seemed completely uninterested in your existence
But I showed him your bicep photo
And now he likes you


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahha
this might be a trend, cuz my sister didn't ask about you either
hey i would like me too if I saw that
Bruno Dumont: Damn
I liked that
Confidence
You looked hot as hell


Pretty Girl 🐦: i'm glad you like it hehe
Bruno Dumont: Omg
I got actually so mad
Cause my grandma told me I had no charisma
And I’m not funny
That actually made me fell sad
Cause that’s one think I’m proud of


Pretty Girl 🐦: what is she talking about
You have so much charisma
and you are undoubtedly funny
Bruno Dumont: In every sense
She just shitted in all of my communication skills


Pretty Girl 🐦: maybe she just has unconventional standards
Bruno Dumont: It’s also hard to be myself with my family
They don’t understand my humor
And always complain when I make jokes


Pretty Girl 🐦: really? Why does that happen
Bruno Dumont: Cause it involves irony
Making fun of someone
And a suitable environment


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok to not understand someone’s humor, but doesn’t make sense to say someone sucks at humor just cuz you don’t understand
Bruno Dumont: And she says that I’m not charismatic beyond this


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol, they prob just have a skewed perception of you
Ignore this text ‎<This message was edited>
Dont feel sad bunbun, you have a great personality
And all your friends knows it too
Bruno Dumont: It’s sad that they don’t know this


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah I get that
Bruno Dumont: The way my grandma spoke
She thinks I’m only smart and that’s it
She has no idea about my life philosophy
My maturity
My social skills
And my playful personality
She thinks I’n grumpy
And immature


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know you want people you care about to have a good image of you
I do too
Bruno Dumont: The only thing she grants me is something I can’t even control


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah…it is something you can’t control
so don’t stress too much about it since you can’t control it. Just be you and see if she comes around
I sure even if she thinks you are grumpy and immature, she still loves you the way you are
Bruno Dumont: And she only cares about my relationship with my brother
If I’m not bff with him
She’s not happ
That’s not the point


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s just an unfair burden to put on you
Oh hey, happy new year bunbun!
Bruno Dumont: Happy new year


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hug hug
I hope you feel better about this
I’m sorry if I didnt do a great job at listening
Bruno Dumont: I just need like 20 minutes not thinking about it
It’s just the problem will stay there

Pretty Girl 🐦: Nope, I watched like the first 5-10 min of each vid
Bruno Dumont: why lol
just pick one and watch till the end


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz some of them weren’t that interest to me. Imma watch the fishing one though
Bruno Dumont: they are all very interesting to me
is like pushing the game to its limits
and specially the haboo one
shows how much knowledge some people have in the game


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I found out a lot of new info
and the existence of mods

Pretty Girl 🐦: I just fell back sleep and had 2 dreams about you
Bruno Dumont: Damn
Tell me about both


Pretty Girl 🐦: 1. Extremely realistic, I woke up panicking thinking it was real
You texted me on whatsapp saying hey let’s call at 6:30 cuz I have to tell you about me day. You said you saw puppies and traveled internationally
Bruno Dumont: Lol kkkkkkk


Pretty Girl 🐦: So when I woke up and saw it was 7 I was like oh shit
2. We were back in Stanford. You told me you’ll be coming to donner at 6 or something
I was hanging out with one of my highschool teachers in branner and missed the time
Bruno Dumont: Where did I travel to?
In branner lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: and you were upset. I remember you asking do you even love me…and I thinking how it doesn’t sound like something you would say
But I ws panicking so i didn’t think hard about that
I found you in branner’s cybercafé and luckily you forgave me and we played a game similar to it takes two
The end
All that in an hour
No idea, you were gonna tell me in the call
Haha, no logic in dreams
Bruno Dumont: It doesn’t
But I guess I would say it if I felt like this
Damn that’s cool
But I will never forgive you in real life


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahhaha, no? Not even if I offered to show you how sorry I was ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Only if you sucked me
So what u up to?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Watching your instagram reels rn
the new year is funny, cuz that’s what I did lmao
Bruno Dumont: Wanna make a call?

Pretty Girl 🐦: You can do both at the same time?
Bruno Dumont: yeah

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I wanna talk with you
Bruno Dumont: but don't every come crawling begging for forgiveness in branner's cypercafe


Pretty Girl 🐦: Forgive my dishevaled look though, I’m still in bed
Bruno Dumont: cause you know there's no amount of puppies or international flights that will make me forgive you


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😢
What can I do then if I make a mistake
I can use my mouth
to apologize
How bout that
Bruno Dumont: I'll wait for u in discord
this conversation already got too out of hand


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahhhaha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpsNJCFkFys
lol, plays like "we didn't play test this"
Bruno Dumont: i know this guy
I like him
but it is a different feeling
the point of the we didnt play test this
is to be random and funny so you can laugh with your friends
but is not actually unbalanced
https://youtube.com/shorts/h4UHBiwRC24?si=tJSrZazUakMe9yHQ


Pretty Girl 🐦: that's so cool

Bruno Dumont: I guess it looked like cum


Pretty Girl 🐦: Even worse

Bruno Dumont: I can add 5 grams of my own spicy milk if u want to taste it

I totally did not spend 20 minutes trying to understand the "Pretérito Mais-Que-Perfeito Composto," just to realize that tenha tido is not PMQPC ‎<This message was edited>
whatever, it's still fun ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Morning


Pretty Girl 🐦: how you feeling
Bruno Dumont: Sorry
Now I’m up
Good
So
Wanna talk?


Pretty Girl 🐦: how was your day yesterday?
Bruno Dumont: Good
I got out with some friends
I met the economics guy
And 2 friends that are applying to the US that are starting senior year now
And my high school math teacher


Pretty Girl 🐦: ooo nice! sounds like fun
Bruno Dumont: And my friend at USF


Pretty Girl 🐦: sorry I'm not that talkative today, my brain has clocked out
Bruno Dumont: What happened?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I've just been tired recently
Bruno Dumont: What happened
You know you can tell me right?
I’m here for you


Pretty Girl 🐦: legit, just physically tired, almost skipped gym today and it was only shoulders
Bruno Dumont: It’s fine
I’ve been like this as well
I skipped gym yesterday
The fact that I don’t have a routine
Makes me tired all day long
I fell like a walking zombie


Pretty Girl 🐦: btw, off topic, do you have a brokerage account in the U.S
ahh i find it so much harder to go to the gym by myself
Bruno Dumont: Yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: and I'm just starring at the wall during rests
Bruno Dumont: Is so hard to go to the gym when you don’t have a brokerage account in the US


Pretty Girl 🐦: lmaooo
Bruno Dumont: Watch YouTube


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah, having a U.S. brokerage account will solve my tiredness
naooo
I actually prefer just zoning out...maybe my youtube vids are just all trash
man, I think I'm bored
Bruno Dumont: Yup you are


Pretty Girl 🐦: and agitated
Bruno Dumont: What can I do to solve your boredom?


Pretty Girl 🐦: put you head on my shoulderr
🎵🎵
Bruno Dumont: I’ll try to offer you a diferent perspective
Well be traveling back a few days
Very few days
And we won’t go back in at least 6 months
I’m also tired of here
But knowing that I have only 3 days left


Pretty Girl 🐦: hold me in your arms baby 🎵
Bruno Dumont: Makes me enjoy staying here more


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah. I've considered that. Trying to be grateful of my time here
I'll feel better tomorrow
Bruno Dumont: Well
For the time being
Whisper in my years baby
Words I want to hear
Shooow me
That you looove me too
Puts your lips next mine dear


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha I like

Bruno Dumont: Is to assist in calisthenics exercises


Pretty Girl 🐦: speaking of calisthenics
I attempted a pistol squat for fun, and...it was embarasing
Bruno Dumont: Lol
You fell?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I started falling as soon as tried bending my leg
have you been doing calist?
Bruno Dumont: I think you might have the strength to do the pistol squat
But you just don’t have the coordination


Pretty Girl 🐦: eu nao tenho
well, maybe, but my flexibility and stability fuck me in the ass
Bruno Dumont: Stop then
And train both


Pretty Girl 🐦: excuse my language
Bruno Dumont: Cause the only fuck that can fuck you in the ass is my dick


Pretty Girl 🐦: not sure how
Bruno Dumont: And math 21


Pretty Girl 🐦: fuckkkkkk
Bruno Dumont: Cute
You can do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: yes I can
Bruno Dumont: And I’ll bet with you


Pretty Girl 🐦: i can take math 21 in my ass
Bruno Dumont: 2 full hours of cuddling time


Pretty Girl 🐦: maybe that's what your dream meant
Bruno Dumont: CS 106A is going to be a breeze for u


Pretty Girl 🐦: oh mann
so if i say it's hard, you;ll cuddle with me for 2 hours?
Bruno Dumont: No
You’ll have to prove is hard
I’ll be the judge


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha I'm gonna feel so stupid if it's actually challenging
wow, this is a lose-lose for me
either I lose cuddling time, or feel stupid
Bruno Dumont: No
It’s a win win
Cause it will be a breeze for u
Then you will win 2 hours of cuddling time


Pretty Girl 🐦: !!
I'll take the bet
Bruno Dumont: Are u feeling better now


Pretty Girl 🐦: a lot better
you always manage to cheer me up
I wish I had the same success
Bruno Dumont: Well that’s my job
But you have


Pretty Girl 🐦: I'm trying and improving I hope
Bruno Dumont: It’s just that when I’m sad for no reason
I just don’t tell u
But you make me fell better
When I tell u is not something that can easily be solved
It’s not that I hide from u
Is just that I get over it so quickly
That is not worth to bother with it


Pretty Girl 🐦: ok, as long as you feel better
Bruno Dumont: My mom tells me she thinks I’m bipolar cause if I’m sad I can grt over it in like less than one hour


Pretty Girl 🐦: hhahahaha
I think that could also be a sign of a healthy and rational mentality
Bruno Dumont: Sei lá


Pretty Girl 🐦: all your feelings have worth to me though, so don't let that stop you from talking it out with me
Bruno Dumont: Ok
I’m so horny


Pretty Girl 🐦: lmaoo

Bruno Dumont: Well yeah

Bruno Dumont: That’s very informal

Bruno Dumont: Na moral?

I just remember a cool story
A friend of mine i saw yesterday was at a debate competition and apparently one girl there had stanford as her dream school. She asked him to ask me what is the most important thing to get into stanford. I didn’t knew he was with another person so I answered with just blowjob meaning you have to blow the AO and she saw that lol. I only discovered this now and it’s so funny

Bruno Dumont: We were playing league all night
I gave my all in all games
And lost all of them
Except for one


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha cute
Bruno Dumont: That one was complete bullshit
My friend forgot to pick something so important my team gave up before the game started
Me and my other friend decided we would focus instead of winning in just killing a single enemy so many times he would just give up


Pretty Girl 🐦: did that work?
Bruno Dumont: We would just drop anything to kill him


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol
Bruno Dumont: No cause once you kill them a lot they stop giving you gold


Pretty Girl 🐦: I gave into my stardew valley addiction
Bruno Dumont: My friend who made the mistake decided he would just go around the map annoying our own team


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was like imma just play one day, I am halfway into fall now
Bruno Dumont: And after half way we would just go into the enemy base and dance
Literally dance


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahaha
Bruno Dumont: And after all of that
We still fucking won the game
Imagine this
We tried to win 10 games with all out might
And the one we did everything wrong we won
We got so shocked we laughed out loud for 5 minutes
I couldn’t breathe from laughing so much
That’s when I recorded that video


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol, that says something about the game as well as the players
Bruno Dumont: My eye got worse
Like a lot


Pretty Girl 🐦: what's causing the swelling?
Bruno Dumont: Don’t know


Pretty Girl 🐦: is it itchy
Bruno Dumont: Fun fact about the night
We were playing league
And one of my friends got tired
He decided not to play the next match


Pretty Girl 🐦: was it the blond dude
Bruno Dumont: After the match ended
I look to my floor
And I see this
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg he dead
Bruno Dumont: He literally slept on the floor
I had to convince him to sleep on the couch


Pretty Girl 🐦: that's crazy
man is hardcore
Bruno Dumont: He only accepted to sleep on the couch when I told him my mom was going to be mad at me
If she saw him on the floor


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha
hey but for real, what's up with your eye?
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know the name
But is normal
My mom and my dad told me they used to have this all the time
Just leave alone and if it gets worse you need to take some antibiotics ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: alright
(I think it's called a stye)

Bruno Dumont: I can’t
There’s too much noise here


Pretty Girl 🐦: ahh, hey you managed to sleep with me next to you

Bruno Dumont: I tried to sleep ok
If I told you I can’t
Is cause I really can’t
There’s no one that wish I were sleeping more than ne
But is life


Pretty Girl 🐦: hey, no pressure

‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: fuck :( I just hope it’s not painful
Bruno Dumont: It’s only a little bit
Like really nothing much
Just the timing


Pretty Girl 🐦: it’ll probably go away when school starts
Bruno Dumont: I really hope
It just got worse
Not showing any signs of getting better
And it might be a pain to get in the flight


Pretty Girl 🐦: Did you put stuff on it already?
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
I did hot water on it
And got a prescription for a medicine


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hug hug
Bruno Dumont: I just didn’t want this on the first week
Cause I’m meeting a lot of new people
And firstly impressions matter

Pretty Girl 🐦: My cousin refuses to learn anything new (e.g. he throws away his undergarments instead of learning how to wash them)
Bruno Dumont: How old?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Job and interview: my mom gave me some advice in terms of how to interview and her job seeking process
21
Fun fact, my cousin and I share the same birthday
Bruno Dumont: You’ll gimme some of it
Damn, there’s no way
Like I’m very spoiled
But I don’t even come close to half of your cousin


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, but I don’t think it’ll be helpful cuz it’s customized for my introverted ass
Bruno Dumont: It will
Cause it’s going to be helpful to help u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruh don’t even get me started 🙄
Bruno Dumont: And to know you better
Omg unbelievable
Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s pretty basic advice like just try to interview as much as you can, even if you don’t want the job, so you can get a hang of what questions they ask…how to tell a story productively…
And say you are proficient at a skill they ask for even if you aren’t lol
Bruno Dumont: You might be better at this then me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck no
Bruno Dumont: Your storytelling


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t like talking to strangers and I don’t like talking about myself
Bruno Dumont: You don’t like
But ur good


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha awww that’s so kind of you ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Ur good at storytelling


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im really flattered you think so…not sure where you got that impression though
Its a very important skill, and I need to get better at it
Anyways here comes the bomb of the conversion
Bruno Dumont: Your essays


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s in the relationship section
Bruno Dumont: And the essay advice you gave
I’m shaking


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww thank you. I really like it when people like my writing or think my advice helps their writing
My mom is like…so you should think carefully bout marriage. I’m like yeah I know. And then seconds later, hey you should have a kid while you are young
Where am I getting this kid 😂😂
Bruno Dumont: Lol kkkkkkkkk
No way
Tell ur mom to calm down


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah she really wants me to have a child for some reason. But I think she is slightly delusional
Ok last section.
My sister made me the cutest gift ever
Bruno Dumont: Wait wait wait
I want more details


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: On the part your mom said those bombs
Cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: You might think it looks trash but omg I love it sooooo much
Bruno Dumont: Damn you think so lowly of me?


Pretty Girl 🐦: And the story behind it as well
well idk, I took a pretty bad photo of it
I think she even tried to draw mushrooms but gave up hahaha
Bruno Dumont: Cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: More details?
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
How did the conversation unfold
What did you say


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t remember how we got into the topic
Omg i doooo
Bruno Dumont: What tf does she expect


Pretty Girl 🐦: Kazel’s mom asked my mom “hey did you know Fiona’s got a boyfriend”
Bruno Dumont: Damn gossip runs wild in china


Pretty Girl 🐦: And my mom’s like “no shit, of course”
Actually, if I say anything to a Chinese person, I first ask myself if I’ll be ok with the entirety of China knowing
Bruno Dumont: And so how did it get to you having a baby at 19


Pretty Girl 🐦: And then we talked about our (my) ideas of a healthy relationship, my worries, and how I date for long term commitment…
And then I asked her about her and dad
Bruno Dumont: And they are?


Pretty Girl 🐦: And then she turned it back on me
This is more of an in-person topic in my mind
Bruno Dumont: What is in-person topic?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Talk in person
Bruno Dumont: Ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: So she said “kids?” Me: “Right now? Not before 30 I think, more stability then”
“No no, you should do it in your 20s”
“Delusional you are. Look at the economic climate” ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Damn no
I really want a baby but I know before 30 is a huge blunder
You cannot (legally) unhave a baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha she had me in her late 20. That’s why she wants me to do the same
Bruno Dumont: And look how u turned out
Total failure


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know ri-
Ok
Hahah
I do have to say there was a slight blunder in my beginning years
Bruno Dumont: What?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruh they no offense but my parents where not ready to be parents loll
In my humble opinion
Ok I’m about to over share
So imma put a pause on this convo
Bruno Dumont: I’m your boyfriend
Come on ‎<This message was edited>
You can sharee anything with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
My mom didn’t even want a child
But she got pregnant and was like fuck it we ball
Bruno Dumont: That’s so normal
I would bet half of the children in Brazil are not planed
I’m not sure I was either


Pretty Girl 🐦: So I was mostly raised by my grandparents
And so when I said “no child in 20s” she was like you can give your kid to me
And my life (no lie) flashed before my eyes
Bruno Dumont: Damn


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was like absolutely not. Not repeating that mistake
Bruno Dumont: You know I would never accept this right? If I ever have a baby I’m going to be part of every little part of their life


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s what I want for my kid as well. If I have a kid, I want them to feel so secure about my love and care for them
Bruno Dumont: I just can’t imagine giving my child away to someone else


Pretty Girl 🐦: this is a serious topic
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: Idk if I wanna keep talking bout it right now
Bruno Dumont: But we’re not making any decisions
You’re just telling ur mom’s opinion
But that’s something we are going to talk about really in the future
I was just curious


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, I concur.
So anyways, how do you marry someone in stardew valley?
Bruno Dumont: Damn your mom really got to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I want to have a kid while my character is still in her 20s
and give it to the dad who keeps sending me money in the mail box ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Are u marring Maru?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yess
Bruno Dumont: Good luck having a kid


Pretty Girl 🐦: No way
Bruno Dumont: What?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is the game not gonna allow me to have a kid?
Bruno Dumont: You can adopt


Pretty Girl 🐦: meh, the game needs to catch up. IVF is all the hype right now
Bruno Dumont: What’s that?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s when you fertilize an egg outside of body
Bruno Dumont: Fifi
I have to tell you something
The story your mom told u is not true
Babies don’t come in eggs


Pretty Girl 🐦: What story
Hahahah
Bruno Dumont: When the mommy and the daddy love each other so much


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wait wait I’m actually so curious now
Bruno Dumont: The daddy plants his little seed
The mommy waters it every day
And in 9 months a beautiful tree is born


Pretty Girl 🐦: When you ask your parents where babies/you come from, what did they say?
I never heard this story. My mom told me I came from a trashcan
Bruno Dumont: The mommy and daddy smoke the plant and fuck all night long
That’s how babies are born


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha
That was good
Bruno Dumont: Thanks
I know a thing or two


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is that what your parents told you? The plant story? ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I don’t think they told me
I just figured it out
I don’t remember anything


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah me too.
I think I just found my next book to read
Bruno Dumont: What book?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
The book is kinda obscure I think. Red Doc> by Anne Carson.
Nvm not obscure at all, it was nominated for best poetry in 2013
Strange. The one I’m reading now is also bout poetry. _Letters to a young poet_ ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Awww

Pretty Girl 🐦: A vai se fuder
Bruno Dumont: For reading poetry
Vai você caralho


Pretty Girl 🐦: vai pro caralho porra
I have no idea what they mean
It’s just lines in my notes app I collected from you ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Go fuck yourself


Pretty Girl 🐦: Under “fuck you”
Bruno Dumont: The way you said it was a little offensive


Pretty Girl 🐦: A little?
Bruno Dumont: A lot lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha like bad offensive?
Bruno Dumont: The “A” in the beginning makes it way for offending


Pretty Girl 🐦: Pq?
Bruno Dumont: Cause it fells like you really mean it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Woah
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know lol
It just felt offensive to me
Maybe I’m just to sentimental


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, I’ll use it without the a next time
Bruno Dumont: Actually don’t
I don’t think I agree with what I said


Pretty Girl 🐦: wanna give me something to add to my list?
Bruno Dumont: I think I just misinterpreted your text
‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
But you are right though
I’ll only yell at you through text
I like hearing you speak Portuguese
Bruno Dumont: Too bad I don’t know how


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im listening to a beautiful song right now. But I gotta translate the lyrics later
Bruno Dumont: Send me the song


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well you better learn right now
https://open.spotify.com/track/2myQE9T8UAbl5u6Wg3UT2J?si=o3FKZVZ0Q_anHz1KhGg_DA

Bruno Dumont: Unknown


Pretty Girl 🐦: i like it though, such a soothing song
Bruno Dumont: Good

We started a conversation and he didn’t knew where I was from

He was like your English is so good
That made me happy
I know that’s so stupid cause I’ve been living in the us now
But I got so proud of my conversation in English with a stranger in the airport
Acting like a little translator

Bruno Dumont: Oh
Good joke
He became a meme
Cause he said in one of his videos
“Maldito homem que acredita no homem”
It’s hard to translate but would be something on the lines of
“Doomed is the man that belives in the man”
Cause of people who were friends with him but turned their backs when this shit came out
There’s memes like when your gymbro is training with other person and then he says that

Bruno Dumont: 4 more hours


Pretty Girl 🐦: And then another one?
Bruno Dumont: Why?
Why do you hate me
Really hard choice for me
I think I couldn’t pick one over the other


Pretty Girl 🐦: I though you said you plane lands at 20:00 ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Nop
It lands 6:21 apparently
I’ll get at stanford by 8


Pretty Girl 🐦: !!
‎sticker omitted
Excitado
Bruno Dumont: Excitada*


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would pick my gym bro for sure
Bruno Dumont: But I don’t know if that’s what you ment


Pretty Girl 🐦: I have no idea what I meant
Lemme Google translate
Bruno Dumont: Excitado means horny
Not excited
And since you have a pussy you need to use excitada


Pretty Girl 🐦: then I mean excitada
Bruno Dumont: Ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m gonna take a nap now
Bruno Dumont: Good nap pretty girl

Damn I’m so bored


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damnn
Good thing your blurred it, otherwise I could be so turned on by Jessica’s face
Bruno Dumont: Let’s do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll we could try
Bruno Dumont: It’s onlt funny when I do it
It’s way to hard even for me
Cause there’s not feet on the ground to take some of the height


Pretty Girl 🐦: I got us a few extra hours of the room for tomorrow morning
Bruno Dumont: How?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I asked her if I could have you over in the morning (implying that’s when you are arriving)
Bruno Dumont: Omg ur so shy lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: And she was like yeah I can just come over later
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: You had to lie just not to admit you want to sleep with me
I just told my roommate I won’t be sleeping in the room


Pretty Girl 🐦: I didn’t lie
I implied
Yeah but you do that and you feel chad
But when I do that I feel like a slut
Bruno Dumont: Feminist Fiona attacks again
Well I don’t fell like a chad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nah I’m just biased
Bruno Dumont: And you shouldn’t fell like a slut
You’re my girlfriend


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know I shouldn’t
Bruno Dumont: Is perfectly normal for u to sleep with me
Is not like I’m just a hook up
There’s nothing wrong with it
Sex is just another thing in life
Is just like poop
There’s nothing wrong with it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Logically I know that
Bruno Dumont: Everybody does this
Is just not something you should be talking about openly
If you know that is just a matter of time
Till you know this emotionally as well


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, with time my emotional side will come around
Bruno Dumont: ‎You deleted this message.


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: But that makes me wonder
How horny you were
To let me fuck you so fast


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey, I was not very horny
Bruno Dumont: I expected it to take like 3 tries to do preliminaries and a few months for sex


Pretty Girl 🐦: You just were (and still are) very hot
Bruno Dumont: Twisting my own words agains me?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Can you blame me
Bruno Dumont: Damn ur so mean
I don’t blame it on you
Blame it on the night
Aaaight
Don’t blame it on me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn you had a whole game plan lol
Bruno Dumont: Blame it on the night


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
Bruno Dumont: The plan was simple
Everytime I was alone with u I wanted to make progress
I would do everything that your confortable with
And slowly apply progressive overload
But on the first try I already took my dick out
On the second one you blew me and got naked
And on the third I jerked you off
Amazing progress
It almost looked like we were juiced
Specially since our early stage lack of chemistry


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll, training for strength
Low reps, high weight
Bruno Dumont: That still puzzles me
Cause really
That first date
Was the most horrendous thing I ever witnessed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahha
Bruno Dumont: And now our relationship is going so well
It almost fells impossible


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah. What changed. I have to reflect on that
Bruno Dumont: (No jokes) perks of being a mature couple
We slowly built intimacy
A relashionship is work
We just worked on it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hell ya
Bruno Dumont: I was actually researching about it
I saw a video of a couple that conducted a study on couples
And factors that lead to sucessfull and unsuccessful relationships
And I got 2 advice I found interesting
I wanted to share with you
To see if you would want to do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Of course, let’s hear it
Bruno Dumont: I also saw that apparently having a sexually fulfilling relationship is one of the most strong predictor of hapiness
I’ll tell you that in person


Pretty Girl 🐦: (just don’t let it be spread sheets)
Bruno Dumont: Why lol?
I love spread sheets
(It’s not btw)
But still


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh my, I found this reel, where a couple annually did a mutual report on each others performance or something? I get the idea, but it was so business like that I was very turned off towards it ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Well I don’t see a problem in that specifically
But I get what ur saying
But sometimes is important to rationalize things


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I agree. But her approach is not my approach
Bruno Dumont: ‎You deleted this message.


Pretty Girl 🐦: Eu vi isso
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I’m glad
I wouldn’t say if I didn’t want you seeing


Pretty Girl 🐦: im going to take a second rest
Brain hurty
Bruno Dumont: Ok
Is it my fault?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No, it’s the jet lag
Bruno Dumont: Ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ve been feeling it since landing
Bruno Dumont: Get good rest
Cause I won’t let you sleep that much


Pretty Girl 🐦: You too bunbun
Bruno Dumont: You’re more screwed than me in jet lag


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t know how you are gonna feel well enough to fuck tonight 😂
Bruno Dumont: Like way more
I have my ways


Pretty Girl 🐦: yep, I’m just getting screwed 24/7
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry I’ll do it only 23/7 from now on
I was just horny
I really need a shower
When I don’t take a shower in a long time I get the uncontrollable urge to scratch my balls
I’ve officially gone insane


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol it’s kinda cute the way you said that
Why have you gone insane?
Bruno Dumont: Is not that funny
It was a big problem some time ago
I had to go to the doctor
Cause it is not acceptable to do that in public
And it was unresistable


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah sorry about that
Bruno Dumont: I’m not mad
I’m just explaining it to you
I don’t wanna go back to having this
It was so bad there were days I had to run to the public bathrooms just to scratch my balls
Is funny to imagine
And there were days I couldn’t sleep cause it was so scratchy lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Pat pat, hopefully it doesn’t get that bad
Bruno Dumont: I don’t think it will


Pretty Girl 🐦: Are you landing soon?
Bruno Dumont: Yup
Had to turn back to straight position already
To get ready to landing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg on this topic
I was asleep and the flight attendant, instead of waking me up, just pushed my seat upright and jolted me awake
Bruno Dumont: Lol
That’s so cute
I wanted to see that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmao I was actually slightly annoyed but whatever
Bruno Dumont: I stand by my words


Pretty Girl 🐦: I forgive them because they had good food
Bruno Dumont: Eu quero transar com você
Quero te comer
Te levar pro abate


Pretty Girl 🐦: If you ever do something wrong, just give me cud-chocolate
Bruno Dumont: Te tacar a pika sem do
Fazer um rala e rola


Pretty Girl 🐦: Woah woah
Bruno Dumont: Fazer loucura entre 4 paredes
Quero te arregacar na piroca


Pretty Girl 🐦: I recognize pika
Bruno Dumont: Te partir no meio
Fuder sem do
Fazer amor
Meter de ladinho


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh
Bruno Dumont: Te botar de 4
Fazer o vuc vuc
Tchaca tchaca na buchaca


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooo
Throwing out those onomatopoeias
👏👏👏
Bruno Dumont: They are not just onomatopoeias
They are expressions


Pretty Girl 🐦: Tell me about them in person
Bruno Dumont: Ok
Better


Pretty Girl 🐦: Or show me a demonstration
Bruno Dumont: I can demonstrate them to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just lost one sparkling water
Bruno Dumont: Why?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because Toby and this guy came into my room
Bruno Dumont: This guy?


Pretty Girl 🐦: And the guy was like can I have a lacriox, and I said those are my roommate but I also have sparkling water if you want
Yeah idk his name
Bruno Dumont: So he drank it?
That’s itv
?
I thought he tried it
And didn’t like
So he threw away


Pretty Girl 🐦: he didn't even try it
Bruno Dumont: Just like I did


Pretty Girl 🐦: he just took it with him
Bruno Dumont: Damn that’s some balls
Taking something from a compromised girl


Pretty Girl 🐦: -1 sp water
compromised?
Bruno Dumont: How do you call a girl with a boyfriend?
When he wakes up watching the grass growing from underneath he’s going to understand what I’m saying
Well
Officially in San Francisco baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: what an expression 😂, so threatening

Pretty Girl 🐦: that's great. I'm not that tired anymore wither
Bruno Dumont: Good

and do a similar but slightly different comment
adding one or two bits of information I got in my skimming


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll, well you still learn something so

Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow, the efficiency
I went to an office hour and the TA made so many little mistakes
Bruno Dumont: Why lol?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will read it later
Idk, por exemplo, he was like ln(1) is infinity, (-infinity)^2 = -infinity
By the way, when you square infinity is turns positive right?
Bruno Dumont: You don’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: For a bound
In u-sub
Bruno Dumont: You don’t square infinity
Is not a number


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know. But you have to write something for the bound of the integral, with a limit ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Is it the Brazilian guy?

Lol
Bruno Dumont: Of course not

Bruno Dumont: thanks
You start by having one idea that will carry you game
and then you add details
my core idea was the trickster
I want a dungeon full of riddles and thinks that are not what they seems


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmm lemme know how the story goes
Bruno Dumont: and then I needed one adventure hook so I added the whole kidnapping and for the mistery I added the unkown backstory of the trickster

cause it actually on what I would consider my sweetspot in math
is the area I'm the best at
and I couldn't solve it 100% yet
and I gave it a solid 10 minutes of though


Pretty Girl 🐦: Combinatorics?

In 2023 I opened my eyes to my extroverted and social side
I think before that I was understanding my intelectual side


Pretty Girl 🐦: New? Or just a more nuanced
Bruno Dumont: A new insight
I understand one face I didn’t realize before
One more piece of the puzzle


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mmm I see
I don’t think that has happened to me. I’m not discovering new sides, but trying to change old facets

Sorry about that

Bruno Dumont: My roommate is going to be out the whole afternoon
Untill like 4


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Cool


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s honestly a little sad
The first time I stepped foot into the classics building is because I have a cs discussion here
Damnn I’m not sure if I want to today. I kinda just want to cuddle
Bruno Dumont: It’s fine
But just cuddle is not going to happen
We need to at least watch some suits
Or reels
Or eat chocolate


Pretty Girl 🐦: That sounds amazing
Bruno Dumont: But you need to tell me what’s going on


Pretty Girl 🐦: My classes end 1:20, I want to check out the winter warm up event, so I’ll be done around 2
Bruno Dumont: I would guess you are either felling unwell or anxious
What’s that?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted

Bruno Dumont: No
Bitch I’m from Brazil
The day I need shorts on winter
You can lock me up


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok tough guy
Where are we meeting. Arrillaga?
Bruno Dumont: Neariaga


Pretty Girl 🐦: Alright, I’m heading out in 5
Bunbun!
Bruno Dumont: What’s up pretty girl?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
But I need your help
Bruno Dumont: I actually have no idea how you did that
I would guess it has something to do like seeing the color of the pixel


Pretty Girl 🐦: The code is also taking out all the black (like my hair) because I’m  only keeping pixels that do not have blue over a certain value ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted
‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes that was my consideration as well
But I’m kinda confused how the colors work
Bruno Dumont: You can do something along the lines of
It is black if green red and blue are less then 50
If it doesn’t work change it
Try 10, 50, 100, 150 and stuff in between


Pretty Girl 🐦: average = (pixel.red + pixel.green + pixel.blue) / 3
this is what they showed us in class
Bruno Dumont: To identify the background?


Pretty Girl 🐦: this is my code, but the average thing is what they showed in class
Bruno Dumont: Try changing the 1.2


Pretty Girl 🐦: yes for removing a blue bg
i think the problem is that my hair looks blue
Bruno Dumont: No
There should be a threshold that works
Just try a bunch of number’s


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok it’s working
Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: But idk why
Bruno Dumont: What did you do?


Pretty Girl 🐦: i just increased
to like 1.6
Bruno Dumont: Good


Pretty Girl 🐦: can you help me understand why though?
Bruno Dumont: No
I’m not sure I understand


Pretty Girl 🐦: lolll ok
Bruno Dumont: What are you doing on the if


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: What is inside the if

this is provided code

Hey do you wanna get dinner together or nah
Lol I just shared my hw with my mom and she is impressed
Bruno Dumont: It is impressive
But I doubt that’s true


Pretty Girl 🐦: doubt that's true?
Bruno Dumont: No way you have a mom
I don’t believe it


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahaha
i would say the possibility of that is slightly higher than my mom getting impressed
Bruno Dumont: It’s not that
I just never saw her
You don’t want to show me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ohhh
Bruno Dumont: So the only possibility left
Is that she doesn’t exist


Pretty Girl 🐦: No that is not true
Bruno Dumont: Cause if she existed I would have met her onxe


Pretty Girl 🐦: you’ll meet her. I’ll make it happen
Bruno Dumont: Sure

Yo did you bring an umbrella to class?
Bruno Dumont: No I didn’t
Oh I was confused about the other letters
Thanks
I was going to email my TA my dreams
But each dream needs to be 100 words long
And is worth 2 points
Out of 1000


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol
Hopefully the rain stops when your class ends. I am soaked
Bruno Dumont: Me too lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: If you need an umbrella, I’ll bring you one
Bruno Dumont: Cute
But I’m biking


Pretty Girl 🐦: You can try biking with umbrella, that’s what I did
So only my right arm is soaked
Bruno Dumont: I wear a waterproof kacket
And gloves


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh nice

No

Prob rational numbers
Bruno Dumont: well it makes a lot of difference


Pretty Girl 🐦: Let’s just say the final inequality should be a whole number like p <= 0
Bruno Dumont: that's not that simple


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo it’s not just me who disliked the TA
The room was packed but now everyone is leaving
I figured out why branner’s elevator has both level 1 and level L
Bruno Dumont: Why?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
It’s for people in wheel chairs to get from L to 1
Remember how you had to run up stairs to get to floor 1?
Boom

good night <3
Bruno Dumont: Just wanted to make sure you knew that
Not a chance
Only if I stop training
Cause I’m a man
So I’m probably putting muscles faster
Specially back that’s my best muscle in terms of force


Pretty Girl 🐦: Then my five year goal is to match your pull ups with however much you weigh
Bruno Dumont: I’m also skinny af good for pull ups
Forget about it
Don’t compare yourself to me


Pretty Girl 🐦: it’s just for fun

Bom dia
Bruno Dumont: I’ll translate it to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
Bruno Dumont: I woke up super late today


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think I understood bout 30%
Did you get breakfast?

Bruno Dumont: Why is it in chinese?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol, I restarted my computer and now my chrome is in Chinese
Idk why
I also can’t recite this formula in English
Bruno Dumont: Math is a language
So there’s no equation in English
Is either a equation or English


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
It’s cause I can’t understand math as a language
So I have to substitute it with another language
Do you remember the multiplication chart better in English or Portuguese
Bruno Dumont: I remember it as numbers
8x8 = 64


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh my
I think I remember them as sounds
I have the same problem with Pi, I can only recite in Chinese
This is interesting
Bruno Dumont: I see it as numbers
I just translate it to a language
If I need to comunicate this idea


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wonder what caused this difference in perception
Bruno Dumont: I wonder if there’s correlation


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it’s my lack of…comprehension?
Bruno Dumont: With this and me been good at math and you at linguistics
No cause when I learned basic shit I was like this without comprehension


Pretty Girl 🐦: True true
Hmm imma research this
Fascinating
Bruno Dumont: Let’s talk about it more in person
hey
I shared my location with you
on find my iphone

It looks like white chocolate. I am drooling
Bruno Dumont: What do you think about this?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it’s depends on the age group.
For example, if you have a stable life at 30, 2 years is an acceptable time to consider marriage. But if you are younger, more time wouldn’t hurt
Bruno Dumont: yeah acceptable
but what do you think is the optimal


Pretty Girl 🐦: What are your thoughts
Can you specify what you mean by optimal?
Bruno Dumont: suppose on the x axis is the time spend dating and on the y axiss is the expected happiness of the mariage
find the max of f(x) over the real numbers


Pretty Girl 🐦: Woah, that makes it very clear
Hmm
Bruno Dumont: you may assume the function is continous


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
Man this is complicated, I don’t think a general solution is going to work for this function
But if I had to throw out a number based on feeling, I would say ~4
You?
Bruno Dumont: where's your calculations
?


Pretty Girl 🐦: That answer is based on feeling
No calculations
Bruno Dumont: We need to find the maximum over the manifold denifed by the living age


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🤯
Bruno Dumont: since the living age is bounded and closed we know we are working on a compact set


Pretty Girl 🐦: Uhhuh
Bruno Dumont: on a compact set all critical points can be found using the lagrange multiplier


Pretty Girl 🐦: Btw, I cannot figure out my cs pset bunbun. I need your help please ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: with the critical points we need to see if they are local maxima, local minima or settle points
but since we are on a compact set every continuous function achives a global maxima and minima over the set
hence we just need to compare the critical points and get the higher one
and that concludes our proof


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2VCwGjuJDy/?igsh=MWQ1ZGUxMzBkMA==
So what is your answer
Bruno Dumont: I saw that
2 years living together


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wanna do that with you

Bruno Dumont: Why do they teach how to do the assignments on class?


Pretty Girl 🐦: They don’t, but they run through similar problems
Bruno Dumont: They need to teach on class the most basic aspect of Whats barely related to the assignments
And then expect you to do them all on your own
That’s how I feel rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wanna show you what I’ve coded (like the final form)

and would kill one possible requirement of 224N

Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn that’s cool. What’s the score 1234
Hmm I’ll look more into this course
But thanks for sharing with me
Bruno Dumont: Score 1 is the sum of the 3 with the weights 2, 3 and 1 respectively, score 2 is jus the unweighted sum, score 3 is sorting by pre-reqs with wanting as a tie breaker and slots as the second tie breaker and score 4 is the sum of the 3 scores at a similar level of weighting

Bruno Dumont: You are
Because you showed the biggest strength already
The mental strength of having discipline
You go to the gym
When you want and when you don’t want
When you feel like it and when you don’t
When the weather is good and when it is bad
You train hard and smart
Getting strong is just a matter of time
You might have ups and downs but I can tell you for a fact when you are 20 you are going to be strong


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww

Bruno Dumont: Fiona

But thanks for caring so much about this
Hey are you feeling better after brunch?
I just realized why you might feel like shit
Bruno Dumont: Why?


Pretty Girl 🐦: daylight savings happened last night 2am. Which means you actually slept an hour less than you thought today ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Fuck that makes a lot of sense


Pretty Girl 🐦: My roommate heard my prayers

Pretty Girl 🐦: Noooo bunbun
I’ll save the other half for you
To make up for my banana bread lol
Bruno Dumont: You don’t need to make up for it
It was cute watching you cook


Pretty Girl 🐦: I gave it to her because she dropped her latte 3 seconds after buying it
and I felt bad for her
Bruno Dumont: It’s just that food is not my thing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah…I know
Bruno Dumont: I’m kidding lol you can it to whoever you want


Pretty Girl 🐦: im just sharing with you cuz I
Bruno Dumont: But I’m watching an anime

Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh you told me about it

So I open one channel I liked and watched his video on best anime of 2023
And picked the one he ranked 1 to see


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was gonna suggest you spend some time chilling outside today

Bruno Dumont: I wanna watch suits


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
I accidentally stumbled upon a picture of you in my phone
And I was astounded by your beauty
Bruno Dumont: dinner 5:30?

‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I’ll join u guys for dinner
I didn’t enjoy it much but that’s okay I loved yesterday
Not everyday is going to be good

Pretty Girl 🐦: I just asked akira, and I think she wants just a 1 on 1 this time ‎<This message was edited>
Aww I’m glad!

Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll watch this later
Wanna come over at 7?

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun?
Bruno Dumont: Sorry
I had another terrible night
More than 2 hours trying to sleep
I just couldn’t make it


Pretty Girl 🐦: damn sorry to hear that
Do you have any guesses why you feel this way?
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
My stomach
It wasn’t good
But it’s better now


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok that’s good
I feel bad for you bunbun

Bruno Dumont: It got the nasal ã you said is hard to say
How is that Chinese then?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha i think Chinese also has nasal vowels
I’ll say it for you
later
Bruno Dumont: So why did u get so impressed by the nasal vowel in Portuguese?


Pretty Girl 🐦: and you can decide if it sounds similar
Bruno Dumont: You were all like I can’t say it
What’s this?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because it’s kinda different (like pt is more rounded, and ch is more straight?)
It’s a game - I’m not your neighbor
Bruno Dumont: Playing games uh?

Pretty Girl 🐦: 👀
Bruno Dumont: Life is not equal

Bruno Dumont: Is just you watching a gameplay?
But why is it in Portuguese?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz I’m watching a Brazilian let’s player
I thought the game looked cool, had English texts, and I thought it would be perfect pt practice
Bruno Dumont: Who is the guy?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No idea lemme see

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun before I forget, can you bring my pillow with you today?
Bruno Dumont: No

Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it fits in your bag
does it not?
Bruno Dumont: Lemme try


Pretty Girl 🐦: thanks, if it’s inconvenient, I can come grab it
Bruno Dumont: It’s cause I’ll be at green
And I don’t wanna carry it around it’s a little strange
I’ll see if it fits
If it doesn’t I’ll just grab it latter
Today


Pretty Girl 🐦: just bring it when you come for suits
Bruno Dumont: I’ll go straight from green
Not even close to fitting


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh I see, so you aren’t joining me for dinner right?
Bruno Dumont: Maybe


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sitting at the round tables
Bruno Dumont: Fiona

Pretty Girl 🐦: nah thank you for apologizing

Bruno Dumont: It is
I could have just said it was with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: What you always think I’m gonna do: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0cCelAu2O5/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Bruno Dumont: cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: before I forget, can you bring my pillow (and more coke, we have zero coke) to suits tonight?
Bruno Dumont: zero coke or zero cokes?

Pretty Girl 🐦: A bidet? How elegant
Bruno Dumont: Yeah

You don’t know what that is
You go and shit on there
What you do now?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ?
you just don’t use it?
It’s still a toilet
Bruno Dumont: It’s not
Is just the place to throw water
You are not supposed to use it as a toilet
Some toilets have 2 in 1
But the bidê is just the water


Pretty Girl 🐦: Woah I’ve never seen that
the hand held one seems like a nightmare to use
You shit into the sink?
Bruno Dumont: I have that in my house lol
my grandmother's house


Pretty Girl 🐦: interesting, I thought bidets were just seat attachments ‎<This message was edited>

Pretty Girl 🐦: você está tentando me dizer algo?
Bruno Dumont: Eu nao to tentando
eu to dizendo
voce e gorda


Pretty Girl 🐦: :00000
Bruno Dumont: Minha gordinha


Pretty Girl 🐦: lmaoooo
gordinha
Almost looks like the word gorgeous
I thought academia meant school at first and was confused
Bruno Dumont: You know I'm joking
voce venceu o desafio do peso contra mim
perdeu mais de kilo enquanto eu nao ganhei nem 1 pound ainda


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes I know (and you better be
I am actually so happy for you
And proud of you and your efforts
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3ezC53RxlW/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==
FFIIIIIIOOOOOOOOONNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Eu nao sei integraaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr
era pra fazer a integral de um polinomio e eu errei
pqp
eu derivei inves de integrar e apliquei os limites da integral


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahhahaha
my puppy is so smart
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I'm really confused about basic calculus
help me
‎image omitted
not the fraction - 1
intead of 1 - the fraction


Pretty Girl 🐦: O because
My guess is that the exponent (1+a) has a negative sign since it’s in the denominator ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
That’s it
I’m just stupid


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol, it took me too long
Bruno Dumont: And I know no calculaus
I’m gonna kill myself
Since I’ll get F on all my class
I’m a failure to society
And my mom does not love me


Pretty Girl 🐦: you are so smart Bruno
and capable
Even if you get an F, I will love you
Bruno Dumont: My mom wouldn’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: And if you are a failure to society, I’ll keep my princess happy ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: No way in hell
You don’t have the patience to take care of me


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted

Bruno Dumont: I know my value to you is correlated to the value I bring in
And if at any point I fail you are chopping my dick of as fast a lightning comes from the sky


Pretty Girl 🐦: damn I forgot
about you view on conditional love
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I believe in unconditional love
But not from you
My mom would still love me if I was a failure
But you wouldn’t
I bet you’ll stop loving me if I stop going to the gym lol
Since I’ll be if no value to motivate you anymore


Pretty Girl 🐦: this is making me a bit sad
‎sticker omitted
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I’m joking
Come on
I know you won’t chop my dick off
I’m sorry
I do believe that you don’t love unconditionally
But that is what I want
It makes no sense for you to do so
You love me the way you need to
More than that and it would be unhealthy and borderline obsessive if you loved me completely unconditionally


Pretty Girl 🐦: I hope you won’t feel this way forever, because I will support you and help you when you mess up
But only as much as you want to help yourself
Bruno Dumont: I know that
That’s not what I meant
Sorry
😞
Me desculpa 😢


Pretty Girl 🐦: don’t worry about it. It was an interesting perspective from you
Bruno Dumont: That’s not what I meant


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I just can’t communicate what I mean


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, I won’t take it too seriously
Bruno Dumont: But I didn’t intend to imply that you wouldn’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah I get that
loll, sorry I got too serious
Bruno Dumont: I was meaning in a sense like if I went yo jail for the rest of my life
My mom would still visit me
But I bet you wouldn’t and shouldn’t
That’s all I was implying
Not that you would dump me on my first fail
I trust you to be with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: omg
fucking hell


Pretty Girl 🐦: What’s up
Bruno Dumont: I'm feeling so bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: About the conversation?
Or about your work
Bruno Dumont: another conversation
I'm translating to you
Hi Bruno,
cause she said she would help me with some interships
and I didn't respond to her
how am I supposed to react to this


Pretty Girl 🐦: interesting
Bruno Dumont: interesting?
I'm crying rn
I don't know what to do


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but she shouldn’t guilt trip you
I’m really sorry you received this
Do you want to talk with her on a call sometime?
bunbun, I’m really sorry
I know this must hurt a lot
Bunbun do you want me to come over?
Bruno Dumont: no
I don't


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
Bruno Dumont: I think I'm better now
that was like the last straw
I was already pretty stressed


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad you are feeling better
yeah I feel you
Bruno Dumont: I called my dad


Pretty Girl 🐦: this week is not easy
I’m glad he could comfort you
Wanna go for a walk today?
Weather feels pretty nice
Bruno Dumont: Yes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yay!!
Bruno Dumont: Give 20 minutes and meet me at branner?

Pretty Girl 🐦: Idk
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4hGIBMsol6/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: That’s cool
I would go with u


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll let you know if I found out where that’s happening
Class today was so interesting
I found out the reason why when you add floats in python, it gives a slightly off value
Bruno Dumont: why?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because computers store the floats as binary, which gets truncated if it’s too long ‎<This message was edited>
and so, the error happens during the conversion between base 2 and base 10: it uses the truncated binary representation to do calculations, and then coverts the result to base 10 ‎<This message was edited>
We used Taylor series to do the conversion, so freaking cool
Bruno Dumont: https://youtu.be/ETnBgQFjaOY?si=d6oXT6-NmmnA6kpN
It is hard to be right all the time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Give me some credit, it’s hard to be wrong *all* the time as well
Bruno Dumont: You are not wrong all the time
only when you disagree with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Get some for me lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: There’s a lot left
Come over

Pretty Girl 🐦: I think so? I talk a big game
Bruno Dumont: You complained about my sexual jokes
When we were still getting to know each other


Pretty Girl 🐦: really?
Maybe I was just flustered
Bruno Dumont: Do you not remember?
We were at green


Pretty Girl 🐦: You tend to have that effect on me
Bruno Dumont: And you said it was a worse type of humor


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🤔
It’s a “lower level” of humor yes
Translated from a Chinese phrasing

Wanna go to hoover tower?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah let’s go
Around what time are we gonna be doing rhat?
Bruno Dumont: We’ll be going in like an hour maybe?
I’m on santa clara rn

It wouldn’t be my favorite if it was just plain vanilla
When do u finish ur workout?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Just did
Bruno Dumont: Wanna meet me by branner?
Me and my dad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sure
Bruno Dumont: So we can go to hoover tower


Pretty Girl 🐦: m here
Bruno Dumont: Cute
I was thinking about what u told me
But I think is normal though
Cause I definitely have a strong personality
So it’s expected some people not to like me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is it normal, you do not have to worry about that
Bruno Dumont: But I think is better then pleasing everyone


Pretty Girl 🐦: yes I agree
Bruno Dumont: And being kinda boring
I hate to keep trashing on him
But he’s the best example
Alvin
I bet everyone like him
But to me he’s a little boring
A wonderful frind
But not a best friend
I’d rather be more polarizing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah people pleasing is the other extreme. I think it’s important to keep a balance in mind
And I think your balance is fine
Bruno Dumont: I’m not sad
Just reflecting


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are likable by the majority and have a strong personality
Bruno Dumont: I’d love to take your feedback


Pretty Girl 🐦: Which is another aspect I love about you
Bruno Dumont: And I understood it meant sometimes I get overfixated on trying to prove my point to you
It already happened twice


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn you kept track
Bruno Dumont: And I’m trying to catch myself when it happens and stop it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m touched by your efforts
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: It’s just my judgment gets cloudy when I’m talking passionately
I appreciate you were discreet with it
I hate when we fight


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too
Bruno Dumont: I was just reflecting outside that


Pretty Girl 🐦: I try to grow from it, and I see you try to do the same
Bruno Dumont: I don’t think I do that to that extent with other people
Cause I don’t care much about the discussion
But it just reminded me of a video
A person was giving the advice
To not be too pleasing everyone you should be a little polarizing
Don’t be scared to express your opinions so you can find people who like what you actually are
Like how I wasn’t scared to tell you my selfish life philosophy when we were meeting
And you still liked me
But if didn’t
I would have just saved myself
From you finding that out later and driving an edge between us


Pretty Girl 🐦: this is a good reminder for me as well
Yeah, it was also what made you attractive, cuz you made an impression
by showing me a little bit of your humanity, which is a vulnerable move ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Was that the killer move?


Pretty Girl 🐦: You showing interesting in getting to know me as well. When you ask what I thought about your philosophy
Bruno Dumont: Nah
I was just being polite
I didn’t give a shit about your side


Pretty Girl 🐦: :0
0:
Haha, well I fell for it ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: Without me you don’t train hard
Hence you need less rest


Pretty Girl 🐦: there’s no machine for leg raise here, and I don’t know how to do the pull thing
Bruno Dumont: Hence you finish fast
Hence your muscles don’t grow


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahaha it’s kinda true
I had to drag my ass to the gym cuz I didn’t want to go
Bruno Dumont: The highway one was closed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah unfortunately, my muscles are codependent on you
Huh!!!
Bruno Dumont: We needed to go back for half an hour
And take the 101


Pretty Girl 🐦: bruh

Heading to LA tomorrow


Pretty Girl 🐦: okie did you have fun today with your dad?
Bruno Dumont: Yeah

But I felt that someone was missing
A certain bitchy chinese girl


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww, but I’m sure who you are talking about

Bruno Dumont: What are u?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a joke, that I’m not denying that I’m bitchy

Pretty Girl 🐦: I would suck it
Bruno Dumont: One day we can do this trip
And we can stop by to say hi to her


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww that would be awesome
Bruno Dumont: I think we can do that on a budget
Your trip to Brazil is going to very cheap
If you’re willing to hang out with my grandma
Cause she would for sure pay for all of your food
You can sleep on my dick
And so almost no cost whatsoever


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha nah I would feel bad
Bruno Dumont: It’s not optional


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll keep a tab and pay you back (maybe not housing lol)
Bruno Dumont: Nop lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m drooling
Bruno Dumont: But if you want to buy shit there
You would see how cheap it is
But I don’t know if they sell microwave mantees


Pretty Girl 🐦: Imma buy lots of chocolate then 🤫
!!!!
Manteeeeee
Bruno Dumont: I was thinking when do you wanna order it?
We can order during break so it arives when I get back and we can try it on together


Pretty Girl 🐦: Anytime, there is no rush
Bruno Dumont: But we can wait for me to come back as well
Gosh

Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha Hahahah
Bruno Dumont: Are u going to pick a name for it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: oo I usually don’t name my plushies
Bruno Dumont: You don’t need too


Pretty Girl 🐦: If I feel like a name really suits it
Bruno Dumont: It just looked like something you would do
What about harvey specter?


Pretty Girl 🐦: loll I knew you would say that because of “suits it”
Bruno Dumont: Yeah

Pretty Girl 🐦: what’s my title now
Bruno Dumont: To my love


Pretty Girl 🐦: :O

Bruno Dumont: Cute

Hot ass

Pretty Girl 🐦: ok about the logistics, we can save $7 (shipping fee) if I can buy the mantee through Amazon.
My prime just ran out, so I need to buy at least $35 worth of stuff to get free shipping
Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can buy the pop corners through Amazon if you want?
Bruno Dumont: No need

Pretty Girl 🐦: hehe thank you
Bruno Dumont: My mom was looking for plane flights for summer
She found one for me going yo Brazil and back for 4k reais
More like 5k
That would be 1k dol
And so just the coming back from Brazil would be 500 dol
I asked her to send me the link but she’s looking for it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok thank you
Bruno Dumont: Try looking for china-brasil flights


Pretty Girl 🐦: I‘ll see if I can buy it
Yeah I will. Btw, I’ll send you what materials I need from you for my visa later
basically a letter of invitation and maybe a proof of finance
Bruno Dumont: Okay
How many days you wanna stay?
Just the way back is 3000 reais so 600 dol


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s up to you
ok, can you send me the flight details?
Bruno Dumont: We need to decide together


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lower bound, a week. Higher bound, 2 weeks
Bruno Dumont: What do you fell like?
‎image omitted

You can buy via the person who is buying for us
I can make the contact for you
Is like a travel agency


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, I’ll check with my mom, and transfer you the money
Bruno Dumont: You wouldn’t transfer me the money


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you need my info? Like pasport n. and stuff
Bruno Dumont: ‎Contact card omitted
We are going to buy from this travel agency
So you buy it yourself not transfer me the money


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok I’ll check it out
Lmao do they have an English speaking rep? Their websites all in pt
Bruno Dumont: My mom told me this woman might speak English
You can contact her in English if she doesn’t speak I can translate for you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, I’ll do that later
Bruno Dumont: Try doing it asap
Cause this price might go up very fast
My mom is pressuring me to buy it soon
And if I buy mine I won’t be able to change it


Pretty Girl 🐦: You can buy it first if you need. Worst case, we won’t leave together, but that’s fine
Bruno Dumont: Okay
I love u
If u need any help
Just reach out


Pretty Girl 🐦: What is the flight duration for the GRU to SFO flight?
Also bunbun, are you sure you want to arrive Monday 9/23? ‎<This message was edited>
if 9/23 is the first day of classes, you’ll be starting school immediately and miss half the school day no?
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Yeah but the other days have worse flights
This one has only one stop
And that’s okay like first class is usually just reading syllabus and shit like that
No problem missing it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im looking at the flights and there seems to be a lot of options
‎image omitted

If we ever have a daughter


Pretty Girl 🐦: When it comes to you, I’m jealous of the moon getting to see you when I don’t
Loll why?
This is not true btw, I’m just exaggerating
Bruno Dumont: You are going to be jealous of her
And she would be just like you
And she would be jealous of you
So you’ll be fighting over me

Pretty Girl 🐦: haha like what
Bruno Dumont: This


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ohh I see

What do you think?
Better?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn you changed the date for me??
I think the Monday one works as well
Bruno Dumont: For me as well
Is about the same price anyway
We just need to get through NY instead of Atlanta


Pretty Girl 🐦: I prefer the weekend one. I’m not sure when housing is gonna open yet, because they haven’t released that info
Bruno Dumont: Is for sure at least a day before classes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Also bunbun, I will be purchasing the flight ticket after I get my visa
Bruno Dumont: You sure?


Pretty Girl 🐦: yes
Bruno Dumont: The price goes up every hour


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will buy the ticket if it has no cancellation fee. Leticia hasn’t responded to that question yet
Bruno Dumont: Okay
Scared you might not get the visa?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
Bruno Dumont: I don’t think this is going to happen
To be honest
Is not like the us
We are not that scared of people coming in illegally
But if you want to wait is fine
It’s your decision


Pretty Girl 🐦: Btw, if Leticia doesn’t respond by tonight, can you check for me (on their website maybe?) if they have cancellation fees?
Bruno Dumont: Okay


Pretty Girl 🐦: thank you bunbun <3

Bruno Dumont: I was thinking about it today
Specifically the shoe lave
Lace


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo I thought it was because you were near boats

Otherwise you’ll go insane with my crying


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha sounds like me
Bruno Dumont: My dad told me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww my bunbun
Bruno Dumont: That when I was young
I would cry everyday from 5pm to 6pm and stop
Everyday
And nothing they did solved it
I would cry for an hour and stop


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll that sounds
like a lot to handle
Interesting thought
That you had an internal clock
Bruno Dumont: We all have


Pretty Girl 🐦: For a little bit in kindergarten, I could cry every time I woke up from a nap
I’m glad you grew out of it
Bruno Dumont: Is Stanford kindergarten?
Cause u still do that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, it’s def better than my kindergarten, cuz the teacher there didn’t care I was crying. But I think you would
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
I would like awn sleep more
My baby is tired
Came here I’ll give u a hug

Bruno Dumont: What does that mean?


Pretty Girl 🐦: She flaked
Bruno Dumont: And what’s that supposed to mean?
She shimbled?


Pretty Girl 🐦: she canceled
Bruno Dumont: She wonkered the wimbleton?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahhha
I actually googled shimbled
Cuz I thought it was a word I didn’t know
One of those band 1 words again I thought
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
I’m good at this
Creating fake words


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m feeling lonely, can you create a fake word to keep me company
Bruno Dumont: No I’m to stumpred today
Maybe tomorrow after the scrimbles

Bruno Dumont: My dad told me there was a nudist beach at san diego
Should I have gone there?
Show them my big parts
Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was gonna say yes, now I’m gonna say no
Bruno Dumont: Why would you say yes,
?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why not
it’s just a beach and nudity is just nudity
But, if you want to show off you big parts? No, cuz..I’ll get jealous 🥺
Bruno Dumont: You seemed very upset about the white underwear lady lol
I wouldn’t I’m not the show of type you know that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah cuz it’s myer green not nudist green
Bruno Dumont: I’m joking

I walked by branner today…and it reminded me too much of you haha
Bruno Dumont: It was a good day
I’m gonna visit Caltech rn
Maybe go rock climbing
Meet my friends gf
“Girl”friend


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds cool! I want to see some pics too
So a normal friend?
Bruno Dumont: No
Gender neutral I think
I don’t know the full story


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see!
Bruno Dumont: I’ve sent u the shortlist
When I come back you can look at everything
But I bet you’d rather pay attention to something else


Pretty Girl 🐦: Okie! I’m excited
Oh yes ;) I’ll be _so_ distracted
Bruno Dumont: You already miss me this much?
I think you should see a doctor
Your loving levels are way too high
I’m worried there might be no turning back anymore
It’s already terminal stage


Pretty Girl 🐦: unfortunately for you, I don’t want to turn back
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: You sure?
You wanna be stuck with me forever?
I’m sure you can find a curly dark haired person who loves birdwatching, crochet and doesn’t use their phone all the time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahaha omg sign me up
Bruno Dumont: Wait
Ur supposed to say that you love


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im just joking of course
Bruno Dumont: And wouldn’t trade me for anyone else
But you just jumped in his lap


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are a great partner for me
Bruno Dumont: Without a second thought


Pretty Girl 🐦: and to me
I love *you* bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I know


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: We make a great team
And is good you have hobbies that have nothing to do with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
I’m going blind with the black yarn
Bruno Dumont: We should make a little trip of ours someday
Maybe next thanksgiving


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah! I would love to
Bruno Dumont: Maybe yellowstone national park
Or lake taho


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oooo that is a great one
Bruno Dumont: I haven’t visited those places


Pretty Girl 🐦: Or Yosemite
Bruno Dumont: Maybe I got the names wrong


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me neither, I almost went to lake taho once
Bruno Dumont: We can also go somewhere I’ve been already


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nah, we should check out somewhere new ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: You’re going to drive? ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: hmmm, maybe not, I’ve never driven in the U.S.
and I don’t want you there the first time I try
Bruno Dumont: We need a driver then lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: we’ll figure it out
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll think about it
Bruno Dumont: I’ll learn to drive over summer probably
But I’ll also have no driving experience
Specially in the US
Maybe we should call someone else
To drive lol
We’ll figure it out
There is also this park called six flags
Ny father said is like the Disney but more adult oriented
Would it be of your interest checking it out?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I have been!
not the one in California though
I think I would prefer something more exploratory and in nature thought?
You?
Bruno Dumont: Ok 🫡
I would like to check it out someday
It is also closer (one and a half hour from stanford)


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha we can definitely check it out if you want to
Bruno Dumont: The other options are all 5 or more hours


Pretty Girl 🐦: and I do kinda want to!
Bruno Dumont: They would probably need a whole week off ‎<This message was edited>
This one could be done in a weekend
Or like a 3 day off
But we can give priority to the one you like more


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I think six flags is a great option
Bruno Dumont: Just got back from Caltech
I didn’t get to see much
We kinda just rock climbed
It was funny
I’ll tell u more


Pretty Girl 🐦: Okie
Bruno Dumont: So
Apparently my friend and his gf go rock climb every day
Or almost everyday


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s crazy
Bruno Dumont: And I have zero experience besides that little times


Pretty Girl 🐦: his partner must be jacked
Bruno Dumont: Nop


Pretty Girl 🐦: oh
Bruno Dumont: You’re way more


Pretty Girl 🐦: Did you out perform him?
Awwww hehehe
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: She had prob like 5 to 10% more bf than you
I can’t really tell cause she was wearing a swea
But no visible muscle mass
Which is to be expected if she only rock climbs
She would only develop back in a small way
And a lot of forearms
The same for my friend he has only forearm


Pretty Girl 🐦: Your forearms are yummy
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I’m hungry
Bruno Dumont: Cause I have good genetics


Pretty Girl 🐦: for you
Bruno Dumont: But I don’t even train them lol
But back to the point
They found very funny
How instead of doing the right technique
And stuff
I would just brute force my way through the boulders
There was one I just didn’t use my feet whatsoever and I just pulled my ass around
And they were dumbfounded by that


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha
I can imagine
Bruno Dumont: It was fun
They seem like a cute couple
But I am super fucking jealous (don’t know if it is the right term)
Cause his fucking gf has no roommates bruh he just told me he didn’t sleep in his room a single day this year
This is unfair
I love u way more then he loves her I deserve more


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww I’m very touched you feel that way about me
But that is crazy lucky
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
But is okay
It is what it is


Pretty Girl 🐦: it’s what it’s
Bruno Dumont: But I’ll tell u something
I don’t know if they are going to last
Just a feeling
But I don’t know


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why gives you the feeling
Bruno Dumont: Btw ivy day was today and my econ friend just got straight rejected


Pretty Girl 🐦: fuck, I’m sorry to hear that for him
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
Really hoping for tomorrow
Stanford’s regular


Pretty Girl 🐦: All the people I care about got their decisions already
Bruno Dumont: No Stanford?


Pretty Girl 🐦: So I don’t care anymore lol
nope, they got into schools they like better
Mmmm I miss your hugs 🥺
Bruno Dumont: What?
Who likes something better than Stanford?
I forgot how different things are for bording school


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s actually insane
Bruno Dumont: It’s like ur excited to see your options and what u get in
We are praying for our lifes


Pretty Girl 🐦: It is legit cheat code
Bruno Dumont: It’s like a battlefield
You try to get through
Some of your friends fall down
You fell sad for them
And then try to survive and get something
I’m happy that your friends are happy
Just sad none of them are going to the best place on earth


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I agree
Bruno Dumont: I would love for u to get a close friend


Pretty Girl 🐦: maybe next year? ‎<This message was edited>
Same for you though
Bruno Dumont: Maybe if one gets in
You can convince them to make the best decision


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll try I’ll try
Imma sleep now bunbun, hope you have a restful sleep
Bruno Dumont: Wait
Wait
Wait


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah?
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
And I’ll be there by tomorrow
For lunch


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww omg you have no idea how happy that made me, your face and your words
I was actually feeling a little sad tonight, but you made it better
Actually??
back in Stanford?
Bruno Dumont: Yup
I think I could tell a bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
Bruno Dumont: But it was more just me wanting to make u as happy as possible


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun. Im so lucky to have you
Bruno Dumont: I told u I would make u the second happiness person on campus


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ha! I forgot about that
Actually quite romantic
Bruno Dumont: Yup
And the best part is
I’m not losing to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I’ll try to help you keep your first place
Bruno Dumont: I mean u make me the happiest already


Pretty Girl 🐦: O m g 👀
Bruno Dumont: That’s what I mean

Pretty Girl 🐦: Lollll, doesn’t matter. I’m happy to see you place first on this one ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I know
I just tried to grab a lagth


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Why were u feeling sad,
?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I felt like I was really unproductive this entire break, and I’m hungry
Bruno Dumont: But that’s the point of a break
Being super unproductive
And resting


Pretty Girl 🐦: I tried telling myself that
Bruno Dumont: I need to go there do a lot of unproductiveness with u
I didn’t study a thing during break


Pretty Girl 🐦: but I’m so used to thinking being unproductive is the worst thing you can do
Bruno Dumont: Baby u know what is the worse thing you can do?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Idk, I’m just a bit emotional this evening
What?
Bruno Dumont: Being unhappy
You deserved your break


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha, I suppose so
Bruno Dumont: You worked hard for it
And you are putting in the effort for your future
So now the best productive thing
Is just doing what makes you happy
It can be duna crochet or just laying on your cute ass all day


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha that made me laugh
Bruno Dumont: Productiveness is just hapiness in the future
But you need happiness in the present
Is just a balance


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm I haven’t thought about it that way
Bruno Dumont: That’s how I like to see things
You work for your happiness of the future
But if that work is killing your happiness now
Is not worth it
That’s why I love my life
Cause my work gives me future happiness and purpose ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad you are enjoying your life
Bruno Dumont: And my spare time with u and my friends give me happiness now
So I’m more than glad to be unproductive as hell everytime I’m with you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I don’t ever want to get to a point I’ll seat next to you and just study nonstop
I need to grab your ass
Or poke u
Anything just to get a cute smile


Pretty Girl 🐦: I like that a lot

Bruno Dumont: It was too nerdy moment
Let me help this out
Hahahaha balls

‎This message was deleted.
Have you been eating enough?
Bruno Dumont: Bad nuts
I ate sandwich twice a day for the past few days lol
Mc donalds, five guys, carls jr, Popeyes, subway, Disneyland sandwich and one at SD
I’m Ziyad lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah I don’t know if it makes sense for me to be a little…sad
Bruno Dumont: Don’t worry
I liked it
😋


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh well, I trust you to take care of yourself
Bruno Dumont: Sorry
It’s just a trip
Not my normal eating
Don’t stress too much
I’m a healthy guy


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m not
Bruno Dumont: Will have health to spend with you for a long long time


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know
I’m happy you enjoyed the food
‎image omitted
I’m so mature
Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Apparently it’s tape
Bruno Dumont: Yup it is
And is a very usual way to refering to tape
But only the translucid tape
That’s durex


Pretty Girl 🐦: Esta é mea durex
Bruno Dumont: Mea?


Pretty Girl 🐦: a minha
?
Bruno Dumont: Meu
Esse é meu durex


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh I thought it was fem
Bruno Dumont: But master tip here
To sound more natural
Instead of saying
Esses são meus óculos


Pretty Girl 🐦: Does that change the meaning of the sentence
Also why esse instead of este
Bruno Dumont: The first one fells like you are presenting it to me
Like if come to my house I would say essa é minha casa
But if you want to know whose glasses those are and I just want to state that I have the possession then I would say esses óculos são meus


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see
Bruno Dumont: But that is very minor
Both are fine tbh
I’m just flexing my port skills


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well I’m impressed
Bruno Dumont: My fucking god
My dad wants to go to this friend’s house
I just wanted to go back to my dorm
I’m actually so tired
I fell so exausted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww bunbun, I feel ya
Can your dad drop you off?
Bruno Dumont: He can drop me off in a cemetery
Cause I’m dead already


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol, you definitely need some rest
Traveling is always tiring
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5CLvnIPvvE/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2zmBnoOf8B/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is that the accent you talked about
Bruno Dumont: No


Pretty Girl 🐦: His intonation is very distinct
Bruno Dumont: Is just his voice
I do agree that his voice is strange
But is not en accent
I could really use a hug rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: I want to give you a hug bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I want to fucking run away


Pretty Girl 🐦: when you get here I’ll come find you and hug you
This is what I imagine you eating https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5FqbcKIgxz/?igsh=MWQ1ZGUxMzBkMA==
Bruno Dumont: I told him
I just wanted to gi back
But he just doesn’t care
Fucking hell


Pretty Girl 🐦: ah I’m sorry
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C44R9_sxn8v/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wanna try? https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4_XuQVyGQE/?igsh=MWQ1ZGUxMzBkMA==
Lmaoo imma keep this in mind if you ever try that on me
Bruno Dumont: You need to try
Ur the annoying one
I’m a saint


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m the annoying one?
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: I take it back
Sorry
Ur the super annoying one


Pretty Girl 🐦: !!!
Bruno Dumont: But your annoyings are making me very happy rn
Thanks for always annoying me
When I need


Pretty Girl 🐦: hehehe and thanks for allowing me to
And tolerating me even when you don’t need it
This is simple not true
Bruno Dumont: You are not annoying lol
It is 😇


Pretty Girl 🐦: st. Bruno? I think that’s an actual saint no?
Bruno Dumont: Yup
I visited San Bruno


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
Bruno Dumont: Someone got in?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Kazel just told me
Yes
Bruno Dumont: She got in?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No, she’s applying next year
Bruno Dumont: Oh yeag lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s our mutual friend. But she is picking between Stanford Harvard and Princeton 😂😂😂

Bruno Dumont: Stanford
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4QoQJxLKa8/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah

Now I regret talking shit about my bio teacher, cuz I could understand this reel https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4fz7lcpJjg/?igsh=MWQ1ZGUxMzBkMA== ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I just spent almost an hour talking with my friends
About applying
I first talked with one that got in
And one that didn’t
None like very close
But I can relate so much to both
I fell so sad for them
The ones that didn’t get in


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sorry to hear that as well
What can you relate to with the other person
Damn I really wish hard work could
Bruno Dumont: There was a period I was sure I wouldn’t get in
Of course is different since I got in later
But I can relate to the feeling of unfairness
At looking at all your work
Seeing how great it is
But feeling like it doesn’t matter
It didn’t matter how much you worked
And the (not so justifiable) feeling that that’s how life is going to be


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know, it sucks that life treats people unfairly
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: I wanna talk to u in person
About this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
What are you thinking about more specifically?
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3jZFsQNCf3/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==

You may challenge my subjectivity, but not my belief
Bruno Dumont: Come on


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Do you really think that?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
Bruno Dumont: In all categories?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do think that about you
Bruno Dumont: Even like smartness come on
It is just not true
I know is not true


Pretty Girl 🐦: maybe not objectively true for everyone, but it’s true for me
Bruno Dumont: But I think I’m a pretty good avarage
But def not the best at everything
Is it bad that I don’t think that of you?
You’re the person that I love


Pretty Girl 🐦: No
Bruno Dumont: And the one that makes me the most happy
The one I think about the most


Pretty Girl 🐦: You can think what you think as long as you still love me for who I am
Bruno Dumont: But I think a lot of people are smarter or a comedian is funnier a baby might be cutter I don’t know
But I look at you and I think that is exactly what I want


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s a totally ok mindset to have
Bruno Dumont: I love that I can be honest with u


Pretty Girl 🐦: but I would really prefer one thing though 👀
I’m still a bit insecure in my appearance. It will get better, but right now it’s not. So please don’t make too realistic a comment about it lol
Bruno Dumont: I just can’t
You are too hot
I can’t pretend like you’re not
I look at u and I get horny I can’t hide that
Is impossible
I’m sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Ok that made me feel good bout myself
Bruno Dumont: But you know what I think is super hot

Going to therapy


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Bro that’s a huge turn on


Pretty Girl 🐦: oh, I agree
Bruno Dumont: That’s why Harvey always gets me wet


Pretty Girl 🐦: I might talk with my mom about it
But I think once I start making my own income, I will definitely get a therapist
Bruno Dumont: Fiona
Fiona
FIONA


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yea bunbun? ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: You look absolutely amazing

Pretty Girl 🐦: fuck it is still bleeding?

Pretty Girl 🐦: Mouth wounds tend to heal very fast
Bruno Dumont: But baby me is crying inside


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww poor bunbun, I have some medicine for this if it still hurts tmr
Bruno Dumont: Is the medicine your tong?
Otherwise I won’t want


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ha! I like

I’m sorry but I am so horny for you
Bruno Dumont: No no no
No masturbating


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🫣 okie
Bruno Dumont: I need to tell u about the application of my friends
I don’t know why
But it just makes me place myself at them
I got very happy talking with the ones who got in
Cause I helped them a bit
It feels so good


Pretty Girl 🐦: What does this mean?
Bruno Dumont: I’ll explain in person
I don’t know how to speak English
Just hurry up learning Portuguese
You’ll see how funny I am at my natural language


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll try my best!
Wow, I hope I don’t get blown away
Bruno Dumont: The problem is all the jokes I can’t translate
You prob wont understand
Cause they rely on internal brasil memes or like obscure expressions
It will take you quite some time to get there
But once you do
You’ll be a full blown Brasilian


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wait for me?
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1m0E4Fh_tV/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==

Pretty Girl 🐦: Don’t think it’s a good idea in reality. Because one, dish washer’s not the most hygienic place to store plates (clean or dirty)
And also dish washers are huge, takes up too much place.
Bruno Dumont: Lol
You actually considered it so hard


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’ll only be worth it if you need to run it every day
Loll because for one second I was like hmmm plausible idea
Bruno Dumont: We will need lots of dishes for our 10 kids


Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0
We better be adopting 8 then
Bruno Dumont: You’ll get used to it
Or I can do it myself


Pretty Girl 🐦: 0 :
Bruno Dumont: I’ll poop them ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oo I like this idea a lot
Sound amazing
I would love to fuck you ;)
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5HqJMFRV4h/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Almost went outside with no pants
Bruno Dumont: Wait
Wiat
Lemme see
How you look without them


Pretty Girl 🐦: Gotta pee first
‎image omitted
Brooo
I’m finally seeing 60kg
Bruno Dumont: Yay
I’m so proud
I bet I lost weight tbh


Pretty Girl 🐦: Watch me fuck it up
Bruno Dumont: But you know what wtv I’m on vacation I won’t care about this
We’ll go back to business soon


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah it’s alright!
Bruno Dumont: And we’ll help each other
Not fuck it up
We still have some gym strength to check


Pretty Girl 🐦: Are we doing that today?
Bruno Dumont: I have no clue
I’m not in charge of this shit
But we’ll do it eventually
I had a very interesting linguistics discussion today with my father
I wanted your perspective on it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Tell me about it
Bruno Dumont: Basic we were discussing if you have a line (a queue) is the end of the line the person who just got in the line or the person waiting the longest
I’m on the person who just got in team
And my father on the other team


Pretty Girl 🐦: Same, it’s like saying hey where is the end of the snake. You would point to it’s tail
Bruno Dumont: It’s because we think of the line as en entity
But he thinks of it as an experience
So the beginning of the line experience is when you get in the line
And the end is when you finish waiting


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh I see, he is looking at it from a-person-in-the-line perspective
And I see it as a person outside the line
Interesting!
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
I knew you’d like it
Wonder if that changes in different languages
But is funny how my father was so worried about being right or wrong
I couldn’t give him this insight about the different perspectives


Pretty Girl 🐦: Maybe! I think you’ve seen that reel about how different languages think of time as moving in different directions?
Bruno Dumont: Yup
But my father is the same language as me and got different perspectives


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, your dad’s perspective is def unique
Bruno Dumont: Today
The best league game of the tournament so far


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think like 95% of people would say end of line is at the tail
Bruno Dumont: Pain x keyd starts


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I feel like you say that for every game ;)
I don’t feel like going to gym today
Bruno Dumont: Don’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I already skipped yesterday 😭😭
Bruno Dumont: Please
Cause if I go on campus
You’ll go with me
😝


Pretty Girl 🐦: oo ok ok!
Lemme know if y’all plan to drive to campus
Bruno Dumont: I got only one wrong


Pretty Girl 🐦: 7/10, did you forget the actress’ name?
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t forget
I just didn’t knew
Fiona
I’m going to campus rn
Wanna have lunch at yagga,

Pretty Girl 🐦: ah I just ate brunch :(

Bruno Dumont: I’ll be leaving soon

Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh bunbun, brunch ends 1:30
Bruno Dumont: Fiona

Do u know if I can bring my dad?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah sure
Might have to pay?
Oh you’re here already! I thought you were coming 3:30
Bruno Dumont: I’m leaving 3:30
I think we can go calisthenics then


Pretty Girl 🐦: I might go to gym then, it’s been forever since I did chest
Bruno Dumont: No
I want you with me
Please 🥹


Pretty Girl 🐦: with calisthenics? I can’t really do much
Bruno Dumont: I wanted to spend time with u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too
Ok then, let me know when you are heading out
Bruno Dumont: Come to branner then
Let’s chill
Maybe watch suits
What do u think?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah! I’ll come over in 10
‘M here
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I love suits bruh


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmao I hope they get sponsored for a new series
Bruno Dumont: Just seeing this
Made me smile so hard lol
I think the fact that we spend so much time watching suits
Might have something to do with why I love it so much


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww, I can’t wait to watch suits with you tmr
And…suck your dick a little more ;)
Bruno Dumont: That was a life saver
I’m so relaxed rn
You are something else

A crochet reel that made me chuckle https://youtube.com/shorts/T-Neoe1OOao?si=NHLMrlr5-h9bl4Vt
Holy hell, the loudest thunder ever

Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: insanely loud
Bruno Dumont: Did u know you can tell how far away a lightning was
By the time it takes u to hear the thunder


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah I’ve heard! a fun thing to do when I was a kid
but damn, people outside my door are even talking about it
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Yeah the calculations are not that hard if you assume by simplicity that the speed of light is infinite
It’s just basic proportion


Pretty Girl 🐦: ooo I’ve never considered the logic behind the formula

Pretty Girl 🐦: But do you get to come 🤔
Hahahah I wish I were faking it
Bruno Dumont: Is just a matter of time
You know it


Pretty Girl 🐦: But it was so sweet of you to help me with the pull ups today
I think all the touching got me a little horny
Bruno Dumont: Lol
I’ll solve this tomorrow


Pretty Girl 🐦: you better
👀
Bruno Dumont: Have I ever failed you before?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No
Bruno Dumont: Not even in prehistoric times without technology (aka the vibrator and the condoms)


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahahha

Bruno Dumont: Pre historic because the first time I fucked you
That was history


Pretty Girl 🐦: wow

Bruno Dumont: Maybe
But with my words
My only way is to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are being too cute. It’s making me want to track you down and cuddle you
Bruno Dumont: You won’t have much trouble tracking me down
Cause the map on your heart always leads to me
😉


Pretty Girl 🐦: lmaoo
it’s true thought
fuck how is it possible that I miss you
even though I just saw you
Bruno Dumont: Cause you love me
Way too much


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do love you

Bruno Dumont: I don’t know why but this past few days
I’ve been madly in love with you
I never felt anything close to this before


Pretty Girl 🐦: it makes me feel so good that you feel happy being with me
I wanna give you a hug now
Bruno Dumont: We need to try this lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will start training today

Bruno Dumont: No


Pretty Girl 🐦: naughty puppy
Bruno Dumont: I’m just xurious
See who is better


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahaha I’m just joking

Bruno Dumont: I’m so tired
Like almost falling asleep on my plate
Literally about to die


Pretty Girl 🐦: aw bunbun, i feel ya
I wish I could teleport you to your bed
Woah you’re in San Mateo
Bruno Dumont: As long as you get teleported with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: ha! I was considering saying teleporting you to MY bed
but I wanted you to get a good night of sleep
Bruno Dumont: Well
Then you might as well take me to yours
Cause the best sleep is next to you
Cause going to bed feeling love
Beats any amout of silence


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damnnnnnnn
Bruno Dumont: (As long as there is no parties at donner)


Pretty Girl 🐦: fucking hell, you are being so cute right now
Hahahha good thing you werent here last night ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Really?
Branner fells like a ghost town


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, gentry had a full on party
Bruno Dumont: Gentry?


Pretty Girl 🐦: So annoying, but his music was so base heavy that my noise cancelling worked like a charm
Michael’s rm
Bruno Dumont: I’ll go kick his ass some day
Who tf he is to mess up your sleep?


Pretty Girl 🐦: awww
Bruno Dumont: The only one to mess up your sleep is me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Please do
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know why
But I never have a good time on restaurants
Like I never enjoy expensive food
And I always get tired af
The only restaurant experiences I like is when I’m with friends and the food is not important at all


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it would be better if you had friends hanging out with you
yeah, food is just a way to bring people together really
Bruno Dumont: No really
I always have a hard time on restaurants especially expensive ones
I think I’d rather just go home or to a fast food
Every time
Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Por que?
Bruno Dumont: The food
Is never what I like
And is always a gamble


Pretty Girl 🐦: mmm I see I see
Bruno Dumont: Food for me is all about my confort zone
I’d rather eat something I know the taste
Then take a gamble on a dish I might not like
And usually I don’t
Cause expensive restaurants always taste bad for me lol
So I’m a great partner to go out to eat with


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s understandable
Bruno Dumont: Cause you can order whatever u want I’ll watch you eat and save money
To buy a microwave mantee


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoooo
you are, because I enjoy your company. But i would rather you enjoy the food as well
Bruno Dumont: Well
You’ll get that experience in Brasil
Cause I’ll take u where I like lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds amazing
Bruno Dumont: And it will all be new and exciting for u
But will be good and confy for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I want something good and comfy in my bed tmr

Pretty Girl 🐦: I _really_ enjoyed it as well
Bruno Dumont: It’s incredible how I can’t be calm when I’m low battery
On my phone
I kinda freak out


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll bring a power bank for you
why do you think that happens?
Bruno Dumont: I was a bit exaggerating
I just hate being borrd
So I’m in a situation I hate
And no phone
That would be scary
So I always make sure to not run out


Pretty Girl 🐦: damn you are still at the restaurant
Bruno Dumont: Lol I’m hiding at the car
To charge my phone
And relax


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel that so hard
Bruno Dumont: But I had a mini heart attack
Cause the charger wasn’t working
Cause the car was turned off
And is no my dads car is his friends
So I didn’t want to mess it up
I tried turning the car on
And I turned the window cleaner (the one that removes rain drops)


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha
Bruno Dumont: But god helped me and when I took the keys off scared af that I messed it up
It turned on the lights and my charger
I’m so glad lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: You took the key out and the car turned on?
lucky
Bruno Dumont: Yup
It didn’t turn on completely


Pretty Girl 🐦: ahh I see I see
Bruno Dumont: But the radio the lights and the charger did


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hope you get to sleep soon 🥺
Bruno Dumont: Gosh I almost drag u to this shit

To get strong
If when I see you I get weak in my knees?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoooo
My brain was racing to come up with convincing arguments
Bruno Dumont: Don’t worry bout it
I’m the one that has to convince you to go to the gym

Bruno Dumont: But it might take a bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: ok

Bruno Dumont: It’s not
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
Cute
Bruno Dumont: I think is a similar thing to what you said about the day I canceled dinner to do handstands
But is different cause I fell like I can’t make plans
And when people tell me we are going at 4 and they keep me waiting I fell disrespected in some sense
Is like my time and my plans doesn’t matter
I had plans with you and in my head


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel that
Me too
Bruno Dumont: And is like the person saying to me that their plans are more important and they don’t even need to give me a feedback so I can make other plans


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will keep that in mind when I schedule things with you, like the gym
Bruno Dumont: It’s different


Pretty Girl 🐦: I get the same feeling from a silent reject
Bruno Dumont: Cause I’m not dependent on you


Pretty Girl 🐦: oo I see
Bruno Dumont: It would be worse if I needed a car to go somewhere and you were late
And I told someone I would be somewhere at time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I would be so annoyed
Bruno Dumont: And them I’m late because of someone else I don’t even know how much
And is specially annoying cause I want to hang out with you
And I get anxious cause I don’t know if I’ll have time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too 🥺
But we do I think
Bruno Dumont: I hope


Pretty Girl 🐦: Are you getting dinner with your dad?
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know

Damn your crash course saved my ass in this section
Bruno Dumont: Is fine I got sad not just because of the phone but because I saw that you were just ignoring what I was saying. I was using my time to explain something to you to try to help you understand a concept I had trouble with and instead of not telling me you were not interested you just stopped paying attention and left me talking alone. But is fine I'm not mad now just try not to do it next time
I'm happy it was useful and it will be outside section if you don't understand what a span or linear subspace is you'll never be able to finish the course is like the core ideas of linear algebra

Bruno Dumont: It’s a best of 5 and I got spoiled that is going to 5 games
I watched 3 already and is super good


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damnnn can you guess which team wins?
Bruno Dumont: Nop
I’m hoping for t1
But I think is geng
Cause they will win game 4


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mm mm well let me know
Bruno Dumont: Otherwise there would be no game 5
Hence the momentum would be on their side
On such an equal match any advantage like this is relevant

Bruno Dumont: finally
you stoped hiding me lol
that's cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: And today, I said “eu vou almoçar com meu amigo)
and the prof was like meu amigo? Or meu _amigo_
Bruno Dumont: the professor asked that?


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I was so shocked that I started laughing
Yes
Bruno Dumont: who is this friend you are having lunch with hum?


Pretty Girl 🐦: And the advanced student was like oh well ela tem…and I said sim, tenho namorado

Pretty Girl 🐦: Do I have to say tenho um namorado?

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha

Bruno Dumont: I don't need it
I don't even have a reason
I scheduled a hume appointment for tomorow

You helped me so much
Sleep is part of everyone's life. A person spends an average of 1/3 of their life sleeping, but despite this, not everyone pays due attention to sleep. According to a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention one-third of American adults are sleep-deprived. The situation is even worse between college students, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 91% of all teens fail to get that amount of sleep on a consistent basis.In the midst of this silent sleep deprivation epidemic the UC Berkeley professor of neuroscience and sleep researcher Matt Walker gives a talk about the importance of sleep and health problems associated with sleep deprivation. In “Sleep Is Your Superpower” Matt uses analogies, emotional diction and statistics from a number of different researches to effectively convince the audience that sleep is extremely important for all aspects of wellness. 
this looks half decent now
I don't feel that stupid now


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayy im so happy I could help you

Bruno Dumont: Gosh

I think it is okay if you are completely lost
But it just felt like a waste of time
I added like 2 sentences while there


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh Hume?
Bruno Dumont: You helped so much more
Go work at hume


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it depends on who you meet
The person I met was great and she elevated my ideas
Bruno Dumont: What helped a lot was this
‎image omitted
I tried following this thing the instructor taught in class
But she only taught this after the draft lol
You can see my paragraph followed this structure


Pretty Girl 🐦: L freaking mao, we need teachers who are actually passionate about teaching writing ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Is not her fault
She missed a week of class
Because she had covid


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah but she could’ve sent y’all examples

Fiona
I finished my assignment
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17dm_YGA-qtXPKsfaClKp2hSJnbNSMyubC_0auLNQIKM/edit?usp=sharing
1542 words
only 3 paragraphs
analogies, logos and pathos
introduction and conclusion
and a more focus on the analysis (aka bullshit) part
I think it is a night and day difference from the draft


Pretty Girl 🐦: Looks beautiful and it’s engaging to read
If you want, I can help you with the MLA formatting (head ache) and commas
Bruno Dumont: I would love that
Did you really like it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes, I liked it
You improved it so much

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, that’s the paring of the century. You are also a great math teacher
Bruno Dumont: I was feeling like that when you were saying good shit about my text
It took me less then 3 hours to do it all


Pretty Girl 🐦: hehe then I will compliment it more in person
Bruno Dumont: Btw what is your research?


Pretty Girl 🐦: according to the summary, we are building a searchable database of MLK’s unpublished works
Bruno Dumont: wow

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah a little niche
Bruno Dumont: mlk = muleke?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahah
Bruno Dumont: there is a meme like this
a guy comented "mlk foi racista"
meaning the guy was racist


Pretty Girl 🐦: lolll
That’s funny
Bruno Dumont: but someone replied "can u explain to me how mlk was racist?"
and then he explained himself


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg it’s like your situation in the school in natal

Pretty Girl 🐦: Smoothies estão seguros
Bruno Dumont: Os smoothies estao assegurados ‎<This message was edited>
seguros mean safe
if you want to say they are secured then it is assegurado
but it is a very hard word not a lot of Brazilians would sue it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Gotcha!
I love you bunbun <3
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5bSQ8wuthk/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: That reel is so on fleek. Period, queen.

I guess my dick is much more interesting hum?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s *much* more interesting
But I want to finish suits as well

‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: is fine if you write print in portuguese

but I think usually we write cursive


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wanna write good cursive tho, looks really cool
I feel like I’m getting sick
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: It is cool and fast
You don't need to take out the pen you can write a word in a single continuous motion
it is probably just anxiety from the test I was feeling like this on monday


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hopefully
Bruno Dumont: definitely

Pretty Girl 🐦: I always choose the least saturated colors
Yes
I’ll have to make a lite version though
Bruno Dumont: I just didn't add anything I already did

but you should be the one to do yours


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will make one this weekend!
Bruno Dumont: Okay

train to run or shit like that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo sounds like a fun idea
Bruno Dumont: But first I want to achieve my goals in strength
then I'll train to run


Pretty Girl 🐦: If you want to do it with me, we can run the dish
Bruno Dumont: I’m not stupid lol
If I do it I’ll start of slow
And build up smartly
Not just run to the dish and be on a wellchair for a week
I’m not as conditioned as u are
I need 2 months prob to catch up to you
Prob because of your squash


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooo yeah, I’m glad you are more in touch with your limits
Ooo

Bruno Dumont: It is facts

And I’m just curious how much better it is.
Bruno Dumont: Language learning gpts?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, people make gpts that basically role play as a language teacher
Bruno Dumont: My dad told me he uses a website called nat.dev
where you can put you rmoney in
and then you can use chatgpt 4
but paying for use instead of subscription
he said he put 5 dolors on it and it lasted a very long time

Pretty Girl 🐦: We can take a look together after dinner ‎<This message was edited>
What’s the task?
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Okie, I have done this in ESF, and I can share with you as an example
Bunbun, Do you remember much about Lagrange multipliers? ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Maybe
We didn't call it like that
but I think I know


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im stuck on a sorta theoretic question
Bruno Dumont: send me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Okie! Thanks bunbun
‎image omitted
‎image omitted
I can easily find a point on F (that’s also on the surface) that has a bigger value
But idk why it implies that f has no global extrema then
Bruno Dumont: it is a simple argument
that goes as follow
1) all local maximum are critical points


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, so what are the points that I found?
Bruno Dumont: those two
(1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2), 0) and (-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 0)


Pretty Girl 🐦: They must be critical points no?
Bruno Dumont: but the lagrange multiplier is a method to find critical points


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes, so I guess I found some local extremas then?
Im not sure how to explain it
Bruno Dumont: the lagrange multiplier is like a detector of all critical points of a function subjected to a manifold (a manifold is just a name given to a part of space like this hyperparabola)
you used the lagrange multipler and found those two critical points
since the maximum is always a critical point the maximum if exists must be one of the two
but look there is a point bigger than both so no way a maximum could exist


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh and the maximum doesn’t exist
I see!
Wait
But the minimum also doesn’t exist
Bruno Dumont: can u find a point smaller than both?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
Bruno Dumont: then it doesn't
maybe there are only saddle points


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok I see!
Thank you bunbun
You are so smart <3
Bruno Dumont: this is so basic lol
plato did this thousand of years ago

Bruno Dumont: I am human
I am mortal
is just this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah but the problem was that
Bruno Dumont: buth with critical points and maximum


Pretty Girl 🐦: The points weren’t maximums nor minimums
So they just seemed like two random points
So I was like what the hell did Lagrange do
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted

Omg I love you+Ferdinand ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: The problem is

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey, don’t feel any pressure to do anything
Bruno Dumont: After the week
Possibly things will only calm down on Friday
I just don’t know if I can last this long


Pretty Girl 🐦: We will get through it!
We don’t have to rock it
Just survive
Bruno Dumont: Of course I do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol, that’s my mentality when things start to be overwhelming
Bruno Dumont: Failing is not an option


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m confident you will
Bruno Dumont: But I think is super cute
How you say that “we” instead of “you”
I like how you view like you are part of my life
Even in the problems


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha yeah I suppose I did invite myself into your life
Bruno Dumont: So now that it is “our” problem you better do at least 2 notebooks for my 231N pset


Pretty Girl 🐦: especially the problems
Bruno Dumont: And 2 problems for 63


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha
Bruno Dumont: Not especially I want you more in the good parts
I’m still hanging out with you Friday
Is important


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too! And I want to help you have more good parts

Bro that’s actually so interesting. One of the comments also noted a cool one. In English swallow (verb) and swallow (bird) sound the same. In Chinese, the words for the verb and the bird also have same sound
Hey, how ya doing. should I come over now?
Bruno Dumont: Yes
But I might need 10 more minutes to wrap this up

Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmao
Bruno Dumont: it is two sausages in one hot dog


Pretty Girl 🐦: two hotdog sausages
aka, hotdogs
Bruno Dumont: two dogs in one hot dog


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fine
Tou com fome

Pretty Girl 🐦: I miss you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I almost shit the bed
real good
like REAAALLLL good
fucking hell
I almost fumbled it


Pretty Girl 🐦: What happened?
Are you good now?
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
So what happened is
my 231N pset I got corrupted meta-data
so I had to copy all my  code into a new file and run it again
it took me almost an hour to run it
then when I ran the code to collect it it bugged
so with my meta-data corrupted I got 69/82
so I decided to just take that since the other version was buggy
but then I opened my files and realized that the buggy thing outputed a file so I submited it just in case
and it worked
79/82
so I'll take that
and they regraded my first midterm
so rn I got up a good amount of points

Bruno Dumont: Fiona
One thing we can do
When we go to Brazil
I’ll tell u in person
But I found the idea funny


Pretty Girl 🐦: Okie!
Bruno Dumont: Fiona
I will have to skip the gym on Friday
cause I have a meeting at 7:30 am for my job opportunity
we can go after that if you want


Pretty Girl 🐦: Good luck!!
We can see. Maybe it can be our rest day instead
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
but we both have a midterm on Thursday
so I though it could be a good day to use the rest anyway


Pretty Girl 🐦: True true, we can go in the evening maybe
bunbun, what’s the plan for your night? 👀
i.e. should I bring my stuff when I come over for suits?
Hey bunbun, are you alright?
Bruno Dumont: Yes
Bring it


Pretty Girl 🐦: uh when do you want me to come over
Are you busy tonight?
Bruno Dumont: Come over now
Not at all
Today was a very strange day


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll be there soon
Im here. Please bring Ferdinand
Bruno Dumont: Fiona
Help me out here
what do you think I should do
don't tell this to anyone
but I was talking with ellen today and she seemed quite upset. I talked with her and apparently Pietro lied to her about dating someone else during the fall quarter (he explicitly said he didn't but she found out he did). So remember I told you I heard about him cheating on his ex? She asked me if I heard anything bad about it and I quite didn't tell her this because I don't know if it is true. Should I just tell her I heard this or not? Cause I don't want to tell her something that is potentially false and create distrust in their relationship but I also think she might deserve to know. What do you think I should do.


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel bad that Ellen has to go through this
I think if she specifically wants to know about his last relationship, you could direct her to ask the person you heard it and from
Like “I think xxx knows more about this”
Bruno Dumont: I heard it from Sally
but she heard from someone else


Pretty Girl 🐦: I personally wouldn’t deliver such second-hand information
Bruno Dumont: I don't think sally knows a lot about it


Pretty Girl 🐦: But more importantly, bunbun I love you so much too
And I’m horny for you (as always)
Bruno Dumont: Much more importantly


Pretty Girl 🐦: Also, someone in my ling class got married :0
Bruno Dumont: Wow
How old?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No idea. She’s prob a grad or phd student thought
No way she’s a junior
Bruno Dumont: Wanna try?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Eventually ;
Bruno Dumont: Like next week?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think I’m busy, how bout this afternoon?
Bruno Dumont: I have a league game to watch


Pretty Girl 🐦: The people who can make it will make it, and those who don’t don’t
I’ll give you a coupon
Bruno Dumont: Awesome
Let’s do it
You didn’t conditioned this in anything
So I just got a coupon


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck
‎sticker omitted
This was all a trick to get a coupon 😭
Bruno Dumont: I'm on my pwr class
and I fell so bad rn
I don't know what is happenning
But I fell so anxious
About my assignments and everything
I just want to run away from here
and the time is slowly passing


Pretty Girl 🐦: aw bunbun I’m sorry you feel anxious
I will help you, don’t worry
My bunbun is the best
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know why
I just got so overwhelmed
And there was peer review
And my thing looked to trash
And then my fucking code didnt work
And I just wanted to be alone
But I had to sit on that fucking class for 2 hours


Pretty Girl 🐦: I want to give you a hug. I have felt something similar
I’m sorry bunbun
Bruno Dumont: It’s not ur fault
If anything is mine


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s not your fault bunbun
There is no fault here
Bruno Dumont: It’s my fault for being stupid


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s just an obstacle
That we will get over. Just like all the other ones
You are incredibly smart
it’s ok to feel stupid, but you are far from stupid

So it is false
Cause Null(A) is not always zero


Pretty Girl 🐦: What is nullA
I don’t get why (v-w) in Null A proves it is false
Apparently, the answer key just wants a counter example. But I can’t think of one lol ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: okay
Think about the function that projects into a plane
now try creating two vectors that project to the same

Like a fucking airport boat
Is a very random thing
For tonight
Out of the blue


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yoo
Bruno Dumont: But it definitely seems like a one in a life time opportunity
I’m not sure about it
Cause it seems cool
But I have a lot to do
So I wanted to check with you what do you think


Pretty Girl 🐦: How much work do you have to do for today?
Bruno Dumont: If I do a late pass
Technically nothing
I think what I did for the project milestone is enough
But then tomorrow I would have to finish my essay for sure


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you feel you will be anxious if you go?
Bruno Dumont: If I go I’ll go
There is no point in wasting time going to not enjoy
If I go I’ll forget about it and solve the things later


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmm, I’m leaning towards going. But the decision is yours
Bruno Dumont: Let’s go then


Pretty Girl 🐦: But it sounds..shady?
Bruno Dumont: Call Aaryan
And ask more info about it

And I think you wouldn’t be able to do anything


Pretty Girl 🐦: I want to understand more
What triggered this feeling
Bruno Dumont: I had the idea in my mind
That I would do something fun on Sunday
And I wanted to do it with a friend
But I just hate feeling rejected
It seems like if I go through everyone at this place
There is no one that has time for me
Except for you
And so my Sunday was again just stuck in my room
I hate to fell like I can’t be happy alone


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I really don’t know what I would do without you
I would have gone insane a long time ago


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will always be here for you, and I have no doubt that you will find more friend who can hang out with you
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
This has been my problem for the past years
And no matter how much I try to bury myself in work


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think some things just take time, and in the mean time, we can discover some new hobbies ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: To be busy as well
It fells like it is impossible to escape this feeling
I just have such a big need for social connections


Pretty Girl 🐦: I felt a similar way a few days before
Bruno Dumont: That sometimes fell impossible to switch for anything else
And I’m scared
Is going to be like this for the rest of my life
Actually I know is only going to get worse


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s what you are used to, and it’s uncomfortable to try new things
Bruno Dumont: Every year


Pretty Girl 🐦: It is not
I promise on Ferdinand that it will not, I will help you, and your friends, and your therapist will help you figure something out
I thought I would never ever get over my body dysmorphia ‎<This message was edited>
But I’m getting better after I found the right method
Bruno Dumont: I’m just saying that
As you get older
People get more distanced
Friends go away
And people disappear from your life


Pretty Girl 🐦: I get you. My advisor told me the same thing about the difficulty of making friends among the faculty
But ‎<This message was edited>
It’s not every friend
Really. You are such a fun person to be around with, and you have social hobbies
You will always have a community
Bruno Dumont: Enjoy ur day
I’m feeling better now
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6UbPmTSyx-/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==

Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww that’s cute

Bro Uber is robbing me

Hey bunbun, you wanna gym tmr or rest a bit more

Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh cool!
What’s inside
Bruno Dumont: I'm on level 3

each harder then the nex
apperently
I liked level 2 a lot
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7NAHeGp7M9/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: What was it
Bruno Dumont: it was basically a math puzzle
we needed to find two numbers that added up to 3126
one of them needed to be sparsed in a way
and they both needed to cancel each other in a way
but the thing is there is no solution to this equation
but if you think carefully
you will realize that negative numbers are in your computer the same as very big positive numbers
and you use that to solve the problem


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oooo smart bunbun
Bruh
estou com tanta fome
the world is wobbling
Would you like to join me for dinner
Bruno Dumont: After dinner
Maybe

Bruno Dumont: Fool me once

Bruno Dumont: Which would allow me to get back on track with a good result on the final


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyyy

Bruno Dumont: I’m actually exactly on the median
Fuck


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s good though
We are both gonna rock our finals
Bruno Dumont: Hahahaha
Like hell
I have no clue of 107
You will


Pretty Girl 🐦: I believe in you. You will figure it out
Bruno Dumont: I had a 20 minutes call with my professor for pwr
I wanted help in what to write my rba
cause I had no idea
now I have no idea
but 20 less minutes to do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll

Never felt so weak
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Lemme show you my artwork
‎image omitted
This is an image
In GT is the provided label for the image
And above is the label I created
Now notice that is correct
But is the training set

Bruno Dumont: Dang

good thing I'm the girl
so you better carry my shit around


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
Right now I feel this intense frustration to get stronger ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Why?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because I don’t like feeling weak
Bruno Dumont: But ur not


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t like having to rely on other people to help me
Bruno Dumont: But you always will
There will always be a table heavy enough
That no matter how much you train
You’ll need people to cary it around
And there is nothing wrong with it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah that’s true
Bruno Dumont: It’s even better I think
Carrying the table with other people


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think I channeled my insecurity  of being worse than others ‎<This message was edited>
Into the table event
Bruno Dumont: But you are soooooo good
you are becoming strong
but that is something that matters so little
in the grand scheme of things


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I know
idk why I got so obsessed
Eu preciso Ferdinand
Bruno Dumont: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19


Pretty Girl 🐦: Did you mis-send this
Bruno Dumont: no
I just needed it

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, wanna grab dinner with me in Wilbur?
Bruno Dumont: Not today
I'm having dinner with Sally
is there anything special at Wilbur?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, I was looking at the menu and they have beef short ribs in Wilbur
Did you know it was Sally’s birthday?
Bruno Dumont: no I did not
is it today?
or was it past already?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It passed? Tell her I wish her a happy birthday please ‎<This message was edited>

Pretty Girl 🐦: They are in your hallway
If you walk to the shower room, they are on the way in a box on the ground
Bunbun, im really stressed today I’m sorry
Bruno Dumont: No worries baby
I just got out of office hours

just relaxing with me

Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha

Bunbun, wanna leave together?

Pretty Girl 🐦: kk, I’m heading back around 4

Pretty Girl 🐦: Looks like a good structure!
What is your next step?
Bruno Dumont: Rn math
but when I get back to it
I'll do more research
and solidify what things I want on each part of the essay ‎<This message was edited>
and then I start writing it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah sounds good! I would also suggest that you narrow down your thesis/main argument first
Bruno Dumont: Okay


Pretty Girl 🐦: After you do research, and before you start writing
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
‎image omitted
I want to focus on the work I need for this first
since it is due first
then I'll shift my focus to actually writting


Pretty Girl 🐦: Perfect, it seems you have to narrow down your thesis before you start writing anyways
Bruno Dumont: bebe girl

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bro I was reading the comments
And one was like “is there an alternative to sleep, cuz I’ve been intolerant after having a kid”
And my brain just went chatgpt mode
With your research topic
sleep and wellness->new parents and their sleep->maternity leave->productivity and capitalism
Bruno Dumont: But that's not what I'm doing


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know
Bruno Dumont: But is cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s just an idea ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: ur writing instincts are still sharp


Pretty Girl 🐦: But it always ends up around capitalism
And it stops there cuz I know shit about Econ and politics
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7KCYNaLhpB/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wtf lmaoo

Pretty Girl 🐦: What are your thoughts

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Feels nice and clea


Pretty Girl 🐦: These are my possible choices lol
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Tell me what u got


Pretty Girl 🐦: I haven’t picked yet
Picking at 3
But you can look at availability before hand
I’m deciding between stern:Twain and Wilbur:junípero
Bruno Dumont: I liked Twain
Is just like donner


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I was looking at the floor plans and
It’s just like donner
Bruno Dumont: Everything is the same as donner
I’m at junipero
And it looks not good
I’d rather go Twain or Sally Ride


Pretty Girl 🐦: I heard Sally ride conditions are not great
Bruno Dumont: I haven’t gone there
I just thought it would be the same as Twain


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh bunbun,
When you pick rooms, you have to pick the specific room
So if you care, take a look at the floor plan
in case you don’t want a room near the bathroom (cuz you’ll be hearing flushing 24/7
I picked first floor Twain btw
Bruno Dumont: okay
Brasil is next level
What is ur room?


Pretty Girl 🐦: 108
what’s up
Bruno Dumont: I'll try to be close to you
you know which side it is?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww that would be great
TN108
Bruno Dumont: cause they have two Twains


Pretty Girl 🐦: So north
Bruno Dumont: wanna go on a walk?


Pretty Girl 🐦: https://rdeapp.stanford.edu/StudentPortal/RoomAvailability

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah….:(

Bruno Dumont: I'll try Sally ride
I really don't want Junipero or Crothers
for the love of god save some sally ride for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey! Crystal’s in Sally ride

My card doesn’t work on the door
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7hCr6vomYz/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==
Wait what?
Ur fired?
Why?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No
It’s a joke
My card just doesn’t work on the door

‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Awesome


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey, can you share your returning flight info with me
I miss my bunbun
I will try this for cardio https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7aU-3igsOt/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Bruno Dumont: of course baby
‎image omitted
its in Portuguese but you can understand
You should buy it straight to goiania
I just bought to sao paulo cause I did not know if I would stay there for the summer
now I'm buying it to GYN
GYN = Goiania btw ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: All the ones I’m looking at stop in SP
I thought there were no direct flights
Bruno Dumont: there are no direct flights
but I'm saying to buy it till goiania
don't stop in sao paulo like me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh yeah yeah
I also misread the date. My housing ends 9/3. But I will find a place to stay till 9/7-8 ‎<This message was edited>
Só bunbun, are you also changing your returning flight?
Cuz that is also departing from SP
Bruno Dumont: No
I am buying one to SP


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok. I think I can get the same flight from GRU to JFK
loll it’s like a puzzle
Bruno Dumont: But would you get a different one to SFO?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes. I can’t find your exact route :(
Bruno Dumont: Okay
better than nothing
the JFK part is probably the worst one


Pretty Girl 🐦: to jfk or jfk->sfo
Bruno Dumont: to jfk
is the biggest part


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Bruno Dumont: and is the one with the biggest airport waiting
since we have to go through the immigration
we need to spend a shit ton of time in the airport
hence it is the worst part


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah I need to check my layover time
I was thinking…could I make it through GRU within 1hr45min
No I can’t
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: what?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I thought they were asking how many passports I have
Bruno Dumont: dinner together?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes please
Bruno Dumont: soon
I'll text u when I'm done
Dinner in 15?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey bunbun, need more time?

Pretty Girl 🐦: Eram como “UMA BARRA?”
Bruno Dumont: Eles falaram tipo "UMA BARRA?" (using they were here makes no sense in portuguese)
Pergunta pro agripino quantos kg ele adiciona na barra dele ent


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see I see
Bruno Dumont: quando ele responder 0 vc fala

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: when ur lazy or in an American keyboard


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh!!
I like that
Bruno Dumont: but people only use it for eh
not for other accents cases
cause this is the only time where it is kinda important to use it
all other cases you can easily not put the thing and no one cares


Pretty Girl 🐦: muito legal
Bruno Dumont: ngm ta nem ai se vc esquece o acento ou nn

Bruno Dumont: Eu tamebm
eu gosto de falar portugues

e tem coisas que eu so sei falar em portugues ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: this makes sense?!
Bruno Dumont: acho que tem partes da minha personalidade que nn se traduz pro ingles
e talvez vc comece a entender mais agora
mas muito tbm acaba sendo baseado na cultura brasileira


Pretty Girl 🐦: Que o que?
Bruno Dumont: que msm bastante parecida com os estados unidos ainda tem muitas diferencas
sim


Pretty Girl 🐦: Eu adoraria conhecer mais do Bunbun brasileiro
Bruno Dumont: Tem uma grande parte minha que eu queria te mostrar


Pretty Girl 🐦: Grande parte?
Bruno Dumont: Sim

Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahah, come on, you know I think about you and your dick 24/7
and your ass, and you cute smile, and your caring side, and your loving side only I get to see
Bruno Dumont: meus dois ultimos pargrafos

Pretty Girl 🐦: Parece bom!

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yay!!! I’ll read it after my office hour
Bruno Dumont: Wait

This is like the only thing brasilians know about portugal culture lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah! I know it as Pastel de Nata
It spread to Macau and Hongkong
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t know this


Pretty Girl 🐦: KFC used to sell it
Bruno Dumont: I watched a video on ranking cousines around the world
And I saw rhe i


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I was obsessed
Bruno Dumont: The image
And made the connection


Pretty Girl 🐦: but my parents didn’t let me eat it lol

And he told me
It is known for its orgies
Now I’m exited
Best dorm
In the Brasilian sense


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh! A person in Terra also said that when I said I live in donner
Is that what you will host instead of game nights now?
Bunbun, lemme know when you wanna hang out
Bruno Dumont: Yup

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Are u liking it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I’m missing my lecture lol
Bruno Dumont: Awesome
Lectures are good

It’s best to enjoy
What’s ur opinion on the food?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I really like it
And I’m super hungry
Bruno Dumont: Lol
How was the play?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Didn’t understand shit
Bruno Dumont: you watched
a play right?

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, but no idea what it was about
Maybe about a wedding of some sort
Hahhaha it was fun
And awkward. But everyone was awkward, so it was fun
Bruno Dumont: Did u dance?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah!
Bruno Dumont: Damn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Kinda

Bruno Dumont: With no training watsoever?

Bruno Dumont: All thanks to me


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha yeah
Wanna give you a big hug
Bruno Dumont: Alright


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you for joining me bunbun this morning
Bruno Dumont: It was funny how fast agripino realized I was Brasilian
I think is because he asked something and I responded with claro instead of sim


Pretty Girl 🐦: “Claro-“ “e brasileiro?”
yeah Lmaoo
Bruno Dumont: Which is a more natural way
But he prob didn’t expect anyone there to do it lol
But it was impressive
I wouldn’t be able to tell this fast


Pretty Girl 🐦: lolll we saw some students give a presentation about festa junina and their accents sounded good
I suppose it comes with teaching experience
Also
I have never heard
Portugese spoken with a light Indian accent
Bruno Dumont: ‎video omitted
It’s me
Dancing my quadrilha
This was middle school
I’m the one with red and white striped shirt

Pretty Girl 🐦: Despite the popular belief that prioritizing sleep is a sign of laziness, scientific evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation has significant negative effects on physical and mental well-being; thus, we must reframe our understanding of sleep as a vital component of productivity
Instead of it’s enemy

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun I don’t wanna walk back to branner
Bruno Dumont: ‎Voice call, ‎6 min
I love you
I just created the idea I would have u here
And u suddenly dropped me out of nowhere
And that made me a little sad
And I just got sad that if I did the same
You wouldn’t like it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you too
I’m sorry I made you sad, I will not do this next time and stick to my plans
Bruno Dumont: Is fine


Pretty Girl 🐦: I didn’t want to walk alone back to branner
Bruno Dumont: I might have overreacted


Pretty Girl 🐦: I also thought you would come with me
Bruno Dumont: But this was not a real plan
We had a verbal agreement you asked for
To sleep together


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just didn’t expect that you didn’t want to come with me
for some reason, I was surprised
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t want to
Because I told you to talk with me
Before you leave ur stuff at donner
And you didn’t
So I didn’t want to have go grab it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah but I didn’t leave my stuff at donner because I planned to sleep at donner
I left my stuff when I ate lunch cuz my bag was heavy
And I left the food cuz distance
Bruno Dumont: Then why did u pack everything?


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I just didn’t bring them with me to the game
Bruno Dumont: And took it to donner
You could have just left everything here


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s what I always do
Cuz I brush my teeth in the middle of the day
And sometimes I need my makeup bag
Bruno Dumont: I almost forgot
to submit my draft
like I was in bed
and jumped out of it
to do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh it’s good that you did
Bruno Dumont: Of course I did
I almost lost a ton of points


Pretty Girl 🐦: Also, I’m very sorry to keep talking about this but I’m gonna explode if I don’t say it
Bruno Dumont: For a work I did
Okay


Pretty Girl 🐦: We never made a plan; you never asked where I would be sleeping tonight. You made an assumption that I would sleep here tonight
Bruno Dumont: I asked for it when we were walking out of the game
You asked if you could sleep over
I said yes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, best to keep a reminder on google
Bruno Dumont: We also talked about it when we were grab the jackets


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah but that’s not the focus. You accused (sorry for the word choice) me of not telling you again
when no plan was made in the first place ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: You gave me verbal confirmation
More than once
That you wanted to sleep over
One of this times 5 minutes before
You cancel it


Pretty Girl 🐦: We are talking about different points. I admit that cancelling last minute was my mistake. But I am also saying that you accuse me of not communicating with you, when you also made the assumption that I would sleep over when you never asked me
But I don’t think this is productive to talk about anymore
Bruno Dumont: I asked you
Twice
That’s the conversation we weree having
Right before you left


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m talking about the moment
When you accused me not commicating with you, when I said I will have to grab things from donner
Bruno Dumont: Oh okay
I understand what you mean
I really did that
I’m sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok. Let’s put a pause on this. I don’t want to upset you any more ‎<This message was edited>
have a good night, I love you ‎<This message was edited>
I’m sorry for how I handled things tonight and getting argumentative over such small things
Bruno Dumont: Is fine baby
Good night
Don’t worry too much
I love you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you too, and I want to be a plus to your life
Bruno Dumont: You are
I’m good
So please
Enjoy ur night
Don’t stress over this
Be well rested

Something reminded me of you today
I was doing peer review in pwr
of a very hazel styled girl
and the title of her essay was
‎image omitted
literally you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
Cute
That’s sweet of you
Well now I want to read her essay
Bruno Dumont: bullshit
not a good essay
is wellwritten
but the arguments are kinda mid


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm hmm
Bruno Dumont: I came up with a better argument for her
than all the ones she had


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh nice! What did you come up with
Bruno Dumont: In one point of her essay
she comments on negative bias
that the human brain pays more attention to negative experiences
than positive
and I told her I would argue as follows
The human brain is wired to pay attention to novel experiences. If something happens a lot your brain gets use to it and it is not seen as something worth remembering. That means that pretty persons don't pay attention to good experiences related to their beauty such as compliments. However, bad experiences hit much harder cause they are not used to it
This explains why if you compliment a pretty girl that is insecure she won't mind much but if someone says something bad that might be very harmful
is one of the argument that makes more sense with the previous one
but I though it was cool
I can send u her entire essay if you want to read it lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm, but if someone is insecure about their appearance, wouldn’t being called pretty be the novel experience instead?
I still remember when you told me you thought I was pretty, and it being shocking to me ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: No because they are insecure


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah maybe like the human brain likes to hear thing that affirm beliefs it already has
Bruno Dumont: but hot as fuck
that is the point
just like you
smoaking hot
like a Greek goddess


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha thank you
Bruno Dumont: descending upon humanity
with the aura that drives a men insane
with a mere look
a scent so powerful


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: capable of hooking any living creature in a 500 feet radius
and looks that can even blind
like you


Pretty Girl 🐦: hooking 😂, am I nautilus
Bruno Dumont: how do you know this


Pretty Girl 🐦: You played him I think
Bruno Dumont: He is my main


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, the big guy
hook and smash
Bruno Dumont: The biggest question I am left with by the end of your RBA is "okay I understand the importance of sleep, but how can I improve my sleep?" 
whats your opinion on this feedback I received?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah it’s something you can address. Maybe connecting with the section about quality over quantity, you can include some factual tips. ‎<This message was edited>
I don’t think it’s necessary though, because your focus is about telling people the way we are thinking about sleep is wrong
Bruno Dumont: I need more words


Pretty Girl 🐦: How to sleep is a lesser focus
Bruno Dumont: I need to yap


Pretty Girl 🐦: However, if she has this feeling, that means we have made out point unclear
Bruno Dumont: really?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Then you can add it and we can see how it feels
Bruno Dumont: I think its a very natural question
if the text is efficient
then you should understand sleep as important


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes that is possible as well
Bruno Dumont: and this prompt you to want to sleep better


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just don’t want to distract from our argument
Maybe include it in the conclusion then
Bruno Dumont: welll
I'll write a paragraph on it
and we can decide what to do with it tomorrow
I'll add more things were I can


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds good!
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: any other suggestions to where I can add shit?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Right now, I can only think to add to the paragraph about what a society with a correct view of sleep would look like
Bruno Dumont: I don't think I can write about it


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s fine
It’s not a point you wanted to make
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: What’s this for?
Bruno Dumont: I don't know
somewhere


Pretty Girl 🐦: I dont see a place for it now
but i also haven’t reread your paper yet so
Bruno Dumont: Just seems like a proof that its bad for productivity


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would suggest reading your paper like you’ve never seen it before
And ask questions about it
Bruno Dumont: question 1: who wrote this garbage?


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha come on
You are doing a great job on your first rba
Bunbun, you got plans for dinner?
Oh Bun~bun~
Bruno Dumont: I’m still on research meeting


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oop sorry
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
Sup?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m dipping early from mine
Just wanted to ask for dinner plan
But I guess you already ate?
Bruno Dumont: No
Let’s meet after dinner
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7ciWOkOhZe/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==

Pretty Girl 🐦: Here

Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7rMwZYsFwV/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: Done
Ahhhhhhh

Bruno Dumont: Come to the dinning hall


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: I’ll make u fell better


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎Voice call, ‎17 sec
Bruno Dumont: Fuck
I fucked up
Real good
I forgot to submit my hw for 63
There is no drop
And no late submissions
And the class is so easy
Missing one entire homework


Pretty Girl 🐦: fuck I’m sorry bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Will make me bound the class below


Pretty Girl 🐦: It will be ok
Bruno Dumont: I’ll reach out to the TA
But fuck


Pretty Girl 🐦: Maybe talk with your ta or prof about it
it’s ok bunbun. It happens to everyone
hug hug
Bruno Dumont: When I realized that
I almost threw up in class
I got so nervous
My heart started to beat out of my chest
I’m struggling to keep up my grades on all classes but this one
And then I go from doing so well in the class
To completely fumbling it
In a span of 5 seconds
I couldn’t pay attention the rest of the class
It felt like the minutes were dragging on


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aw bunbun, I feel you
It will be ok. We can afford mistakes with no problem right now ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Not this type
Is so ridiculous
I had it good
And because of a simple mistake
I ruined hours of work


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know it feels bad
I did the same shit in 21 and almost in 51 again
Bruno Dumont: But the ones you did
Had a drop
Or a way to make up for it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is your grading for homework only 80%?
We don’t have a drop for 51 and 21
Bruno Dumont: What?


Pretty Girl 🐦: But if you get 80% of possible points, it counts as 100
Bruno Dumont: No is not


Pretty Girl 🐦: ah
I really hope your TA will give you a chance to make it up
But having no drop is ridiculous
Bruno Dumont: I've sent an email
let's see how it goes
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyyyyyyy
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
Btw should I respond to this?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol I would just thank T^2 and his crystal ball
Bruno Dumont: Btw how busy are u?


Pretty Girl 🐦: After 2 I’m pretty free
Bruno Dumont: I'd like some help in my pwr essay
Shannon gave me feedback on the draft
and you can help me incorporate it/increase the word count
and make it good for my hume appointment tomorrow


Pretty Girl 🐦: Okie!
Bruno Dumont: how does meeting up at 4:30 sound to you?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds good
So we are married in Agripino’s class ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: What?
You are always pretty I don’t know about the free


Pretty Girl 🐦: He wanted us to use the vocab “son, daughter, mother, and father in law”
And he was like so what is his father to you…if you are married
Bruno Dumont: Fiona
If you want to marry me
Don’t hide behind agripino
You can say it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha

And I came, just looking at the menu
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7x8nW2NT8_/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==

Pretty Girl 🐦: :0 I’ll put that on my list, right under onlyfans
Bruno Dumont: I think ur love for cuddles

Ur horniness


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
It’s true

Bruno Dumont: Sometimes it doesn't feel like it
I'm cuddling with you

and ur horny as fuck


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🥺 I thought you were gonna say something bad
Bruno Dumont: of course not
I love you
I like ur horniness
and I'll enjoy more of it after all of this is over
and my stress goes away


Pretty Girl 🐦: You have to tell/remind me things I do that upset you
I look forward to that
Bruno Dumont: you don't do a lot of things that upset me
I'm stressed because of life
and CS
not u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: But if I can add a feedback


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: is that sometimes it feels like you don't express that you appreciate me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I hear ya
Bruno Dumont: you don't hold back in saying the things that annoy you
and so it can feel like I'm doing things wrong
and you don't enjoy dating me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I kinda also feel a similar way, that’s kinda why I brought up the planning thing this morning
What would that look like for you?
Bruno Dumont: I don't know
I was just scared you would stop liking me


Pretty Girl 🐦: well, it’s best to give me some feedback about what you like, cuz I’ll need time to figure out what matters to you and what doesn’t
Bruno Dumont: let's talk about this in a different circumstance
I don't really know
so its hard for me to tell you


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s a good idea
Bruno Dumont: you didn't forget about our appointment right?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No it’s just so hot I don’t wanna go out
Bruno Dumont: so ur not coming?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m coming
Just taking a piss
Bruno Dumont: okay

Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah orchids! A classic
bunbun you going to the branner banquet?
Bruno Dumont: I don't know
do you think I should
I told Crystal I would have dinner with her
its okay to cancel
but I think I would enjoy more talking with Crystal then going on a banquet
cause the food might not be what I like
the people there I might not like that much
I don't know
I might regret not going


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would keep the plan with crystal
You aren’t gonna see the people in branner after this week anyways
So the banquet’s not gonna bring you any benefit I think
Bruno Dumont: You are always right
my baby girl is awesome
did u see the protest thing?

A heartless monster

Bruno Dumont: You are in bain

Try things when ur in peak condition


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m actually feeling better now, but that’s a good point
Bruno Dumont: You were so bad
You almost didn’t kiss me goodbye


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just wanted to do something fun
‎sticker omitted
I will make it up to you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Is fine Fiona
I just don’t want it to be a habit
I understand you were not feeling well
So I didn’t push it
I’m not sad rn
I’m just giving you feedback


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I will incorporate your feedback bunbun because I love you
Bruno Dumont: I know you do
Can I do anything for you?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Right now I’m good
But I will love to see you tmr after my test
If possible
And then I will grab your ice cream and coke for us
Bruno Dumont: Sounds like a hell of a good time


Pretty Girl 🐦: I got a bite of chicken nuggets at the soap
I feel alive
Bruno Dumont: Awesome
I’m having a problem
I don’t know what to do
For the past days I felt like my teeth is moving out
Like when I close my mouth it seems out of place
I put the broken retainer back to see if it helps a bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh yeah i think using the retainer you have now is a good idea
Does it hurt when you put the retainer in?
You should get a few duplicates when you go back to Brasil
Bruno Dumont: No
Not now
But it is not 100% fitting
It was supposedly enough
Like I didn’t need to wear them anymore


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, hopefully it will move stuff back in place
Ah my dentist told me retainers were…a forever thing
But the later on, you can go a while without them
Idk why, but my teeth still shifts if I don’t use it
God, I still get butterflies for you
I was flipping through my photos and saw one of us in October
And man, you are so beautiful and so sweet
Bruno Dumont: You have no idea how happy that makes me


Pretty Girl 🐦: And if the old me knew I could have you
Bruno Dumont: That’s so sweet


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m so happy to be with you
Bruno Dumont: I’m almost crying
I loved it
Thank you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww bunbunnn

Bruno Dumont: Fiona

Pretty Girl 🐦: I will try 🥺
Bruno Dumont: Try doing your best
And go for the partial credit
I don’t know
Ask chat gpt or wolfram alpha
We didn’t do this on 61


Pretty Girl 🐦: Okk
I already did, but it gave a wrong answer lol
Bruno Dumont: Send me the solution
I’ll understand and explain to u


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bunbun helpp
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Okay
What do you need?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Could you walk me through this question
Answers: a)i) b)ii) c)i)
Bruno Dumont: I thought yours was right
I don’t know this


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s not my writing
I don’t even know how to start this question
Bruno Dumont: The C I know how to do
If Ax is (1,2)
Then A(2x) is (2, 4)
So the solution is just double the solution provided
I think for A the solution is just 0. Cause since the solution is a line the matrix seem to be full rank
And for B I have no clue sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: Alright thank you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Gamer tities

Pretty Girl 🐦: To support her argument to why being “fun” is important
Bruno Dumont: And I got the best
But ur so fun
I love ur sense of humor
You are always in the mood for my jokes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe because you are always funny
Bruno Dumont: You always up for our internal memes
You are very silly sometimes
Which makes the most trivial things
Seem like something so good


Pretty Girl 🐦: awwww
Bruno Dumont: I love how you find joy in sitting with 3 plushies


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m so glad you like my silly side
Bruno Dumont: Or just looking at a flower

Bruno Dumont: Nah ur good
But lemme hear first


Pretty Girl 🐦: and she always talks about us as if we are one unit already
it was just that, just like an advice
Bruno Dumont: How so?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like she always says “you two”
and she talked about how cost efficient being a couple is
Cuz instead of buying two rice cookers, we can just buy one
Lmaoo
and she asked how it feels to have a boyfriend for almost a year
and I said it’s amazing, which she used as an opportunity to say “and you wanted to find a woman”
So basically, the same old topics
Bruno Dumont: Lol
She is right though


Pretty Girl 🐦: But this call was cool cuz my entire fam was eating lunch
Bruno Dumont: I’m dating a woman
Annoying


Pretty Girl 🐦: So I got to see everyone
Hahahah, too bad you aren’t getting rid of me anytime soon
I already miss our nights together
Bruno Dumont: On the airplane

Bruno Dumont: Chipotle looks terrible to me

Bruno Dumont: My traps and lower back


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted

Bruno Dumont: But then it will feel better


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can relate
Bruno Dumont: I dont know why I’m so sensitive today


Pretty Girl 🐦: Just being in the same room with you is enjoyable
Bruno Dumont: I almost cried like 10 times
For random shit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww it’s ok bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I watched a video about the life story of a soccer player and got emotional
I watched reels about relationships and got emotional


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a stressful time and lots of changes are happening
Bruno Dumont: And is not like I’m sad
I’m just emotional


Pretty Girl 🐦: And it’s normal to feel that way
‎sticker omitted
Whatcha doing now
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah it’s almost time
How long is your flight to GRU?
Bruno Dumont: 2


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wait that’s so fast
Bruno Dumont: Not 2 hours
2 units of time


Pretty Girl 🐦: what’s the conversion factor
Bruno Dumont: 4


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok lol
Bruno Dumont: But is the conversion to unit’ of time


Pretty Girl 🐦: :0
Looks like 9.6 hours
Bruno Dumont: Yes
2
Boarding in 20 minutes
They just offered a thousand bucks
To anyone willing to take a flight tomorrow night
That’s crazy
Thousand bucks in a day?
If I didn’t had a connection I would be tempted


Pretty Girl 🐦: But that’s such an inconvenience
Bruno Dumont: https://youtu.be/DLrmGyR20PY?si=o2l_jEl2EAfXYqKd


Pretty Girl 🐦: I guess they overbooked the flight
Oh the Greed of airlines
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
I didn’t take it
But it seems like a good offer
For someone in Brasil


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is that even enough for a upgrade?
Bruno Dumont: Like a too good to be true offer in Brasil
You can make 2 months of work in 1 day
If you earn less than the top 10% of Brasil


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel like they might have to raise the price
For someone to take it. I’m curious now
Bruno Dumont: I’m telling you this offer is good
Maybe not to an American


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see
Bruno Dumont: But 95% of Brasilians would take it without a second thought
80% would thanks you like their life depended on it
They would even cry about it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well I can understand
Bruno Dumont: They raised the money
To 1500
Lol
And then a guy screamed
“Dois mil”


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahaha
Bruno Dumont: The pure brasilian juice


Pretty Girl 🐦: I agree
Bruno Dumont: And I’m still in the us


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m thinking 5 mil
at least
Bruno Dumont: I thought it was funny how it became an auction


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
Update me please on this sale
Bruno Dumont: I think 1500 was it
They had some 1000 bucks options
But I think they got all on the 1500


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see I see
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7zyYywPgX6/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: What did he say? Something about a promotion and being free?
Bruno Dumont: A new promotion if you let me fuck your ass the ride is free
Me in my headphones
🎶😀👍 ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha ok
I thought it was something like that
But I couldnt catch the critical words ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I caught the plane


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are on the plane?
Bruno Dumont: Yup
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Was it delayed?
Bruno Dumont: Not a lot
A few minutes maybe


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s good!
Bruno Dumont: The flight is supposed to go out at 7
So I think it will be a tad bit late
This flight is 9 hours so I might be able to catch some sleep
But not quality


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ferdinand wishes that you sleep well
Bruno Dumont: Pic


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mr pancake is looking cuter than ever
Bruno Dumont: Eu quero pics
Brasilians are so much better
I like being back

Pretty Girl 🐦: 😭😭😭

Bruno Dumont: I knew you didn’t like him
But I didn’t know it was this much
Gosh I love you so fucking much
Is actually insane


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you very very much as well bunbun
I want to share my life with you
for a long time
Bruno Dumont: Share through email
I don’t think whatsapp can handle such long and happy files


Pretty Girl 🐦: I like himmm😫 but he doesn’t like cuddling
Hahahah
Bruno Dumont: Filled with good memories

Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh I wanna rewatch this one
Bruno Dumont: Have you watched this?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I did not finish it. I think I watched half
The beginning was strong, but the middle was slow in my opinion
Bruno Dumont: Is good shit
I really liked it
There is one scene that I still remember
Where they were talking to decide where to throw the bomb
And the minister was like
Don’t do kioto cause I had my honeymoon there and my wife liked it
Like they were treating thousands of lifes
As if it was nothing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah, now I want to finish it
I didn’t know Oppenheimer was involved the communist party tho
Bruno Dumont: “Involved with the communits party”


Pretty Girl 🐦: So that caught me off guard when it was a big focus of the film
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7NPDVJP2qN/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==

Pretty Girl 🐦: You can switch it out with another pic, or we can do another one for next quarter
Bruno Dumont: I picked the one I looked better

But I got ur tricep one
Cause I really like my bicep one lol
Select one more to go


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey it’s your post, you post what looks good
Remove one? Or add one
Bruno Dumont: Cause I want the flexing one


Pretty Girl 🐦: Btw, I just got an email telling me I don’t have meal plans until 6/22
Bruno Dumont: So change one to the flexing
Oh what are going to do about it?
You can buy meals at the dinning hall


Pretty Girl 🐦: For 30 dollars everyday
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
I’m sorry it’s like this


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m just gonna eat chipotle
Bruno Dumont: Lol

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah that has crossed my mind
Bruno Dumont: Eat protein bars

That you are on the top 1% best fits for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: You know me, always striving to be far from the average
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C79bWHlRzQq/?igsh=MTBlZjE4YzMxOA==

Pretty Girl 🐦: I suppose I can see that ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: But that’s so childish


Pretty Girl 🐦: it’s so fun to figure out a puzzle tho
Bruno Dumont: Not everyone thinks that
I think next time we play
We have the base rules
But at the start
Everyone creates a new rule


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo yeah
that’s a great way to introduce the premise
Bruno Dumont: No
Not to new players
But to experienced ones
Cause is already a lot to learn in the beginning


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah that’s true
Maybe just one person adds a rule then ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: So even with people who already know
Is still nee stuff to learn
You should not say anything
Like the existence of roles
Rules
The goal of the game
Nothing
Just say the only rule is not to talk about the rules
Eu quero

2. Omg what a coincidence. So I got gifted this chocolate a while back. Every time I was about to eat it, my brain was like “no, you should keep it intact for gifting” (whatever). And TONIGHT, my roommate asked if I had any chocolate. ‎<This message was edited>
Now my roommate is vegan, so no milk. But all chocolate have milk….(I was upset I couldn’t give her food after all she gave me)…*except* the one I saved ‎<This message was edited>

Which I have some doubts to
I’ll do more research for us
Me hungry
Bruno Dumont: Alright
Me too lol
I was feeling a little sad
Cause my family were talking a lot about travel
And it seems like everyone in my family traveled so much
Other than me
Is kind of stupid
But I felt a little bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah im sorry you feel bad. We are still very young! Got lots of time to pick a place and go
It’s not stupid bunbun

Bruno Dumont: Is cause my family has momey


Pretty Girl 🐦: When people ask me about my vacation and I literally did nothing  vacationy ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: But they organize a things in such a way
That most times if feels like we don’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ha! I can relate so deeply
Bruno Dumont: And my aunt technically has the same job as my mom
And she travels twice a year
And now after my brother surgery
He will choose a place to go
And I feel like the reason we didn’t travel at all
Even small things is because of him


Pretty Girl 🐦: That could be cool
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
I just don’t like how he sometimes is the reason I can’t do things


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sorry you feel this way bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Wtv
Is very selfish of me
To complain about this


Pretty Girl 🐦: No it’s not. You are a person too

In a normal relationship you have 2 people happy
In a long distance you have 4

Bruno Dumont: I only learn what I want
If rn I’m not in the mindset to get the habit of brushing my teeth
I won’t
Which is not that good


Pretty Girl 🐦: But you are the type that once you pick it up,  you will keep them in the face of challenges ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: But if I decide on it
Then I usually do


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
This decision is so easy for me tho.
It’s a win win, if we are talking bout your dick
Bruno Dumont: Yeah the decision if not for the likes pf you
This question has much more nuance than you can imagine
Can you change clothes after sitting on the cake or you have to live the day like this?
Eating the cake can be very good if it is a small delicious cake
Or it can be a torture bigger than the dick if the cake is too big
What about the dick
Being big does not impact much the eating if you don’t have to put it all in
Do you have to swallow?
Can you use lube?
This question stands for generations without any conclusive results
This is definitely no easy decision
But your simplistic mind would never understand it
Can you use condoms?
Do you have to go all the way till they cum?
Do they cum inside?
What’s the flavor of the cake
Who is the owner of the dick?
Is the dick clean?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
you are right. I underestimated this question
Bruno Dumont: Now
Answer this


Pretty Girl 🐦: but gosh given the choice, I would sit on your dick all day right now
Bruno Dumont: Would you rather eat a dick with ice cream flavor
Or ice cream with dick flavor


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahahaha
You’ve asked me before
If it’s your dick
😍😍😍😍
Apologies for being so…lewd right now
I’m just still horny

Bruno Dumont: Toyon?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep! I ran into Blair
Bruno Dumont: I’m ao good
I’m at the gym
Getting a workout with my dad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
That’s awesome
Bruno Dumont: Have to get hot


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im trying to find motivation to go
Bruno Dumont: Since I’m dating miss universe here


Pretty Girl 🐦: For me right? 👀
Hahahha
You are so sweet bunbun
Well you just motivated me to go to the gym today
Bruno Dumont: Awesome
I realized
I was going the wrong approach
Into helping your fitness journey


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah? What’s the better approach?
Bruno Dumont: I want my baby girl to be healthy
Since you are already stunning


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwwwww
Bruno Dumont: If you want to be healthy


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: You need to resistence train
And eat healthy
I already knew that
But you already do all that
If I want to help you know
I need to make you under
Understand
How amazing you are
How pretty you are
And if we just keep the good work
We are already doing


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are gonna make me cry
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: You’ll be mentally and physically healthy
Cause now your mind is not healthy
With unrealistic expectations
Unessary goals
And not enough self love


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are already helping me a ton with that
Bruno Dumont: That’s the only thing that we need to improve on
Now I’m doubling down


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a lengthy process, but I will get there
You are so considerate of me
I am incredibly touched and grateful for how great of a partner you are
I want to help you become the best version of yourself as well
Bruno Dumont: You too
You don’t need to became the absolute best version of yourself
You just need to be happy
As much as you possibly can
Till you are about to explode
You don’t need to diet down if that makes you unhappy
As long as you keep eating healthy
If one day you feel like it and get a diet that doesn’t make you feel like shit you do that
Rn is making you sad
So why do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz it might make me happy in the future
loll
Bruno Dumont: But it won’t
You can decide on that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah that’s my fear
Bruno Dumont: When you love yourself
When you look in the mirror with love
And appreciation
And decide to change out of a good emotion


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you appreciate yourself bunbun?
Bruno Dumont: Than I will be on your side 100%
And then you will enjoy it
Yes
I love my body
Every time I flex in the mirror I get happy with my progress
But most of my friends are the opposite
They get unmotivated and think they are small
Cause they did not work on the brain before the body
Body dismorfia gets you no matter how you look
And we will work on that together


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are right bunbun
🥺🥺 yes we will
Bruno Dumont: But I wasn’t always like that
I was embarrassed of being too skinny
But I realized that apperence is not that important
It didn’t impact my worth
And ability to be loved
That before I started working out
And then I saw that it was a small part
And a part I could change
With no rush
My only goal is to be strong at my peak
When I am 25 I want to as jacked as possible
To see the absolute peak of my body


Pretty Girl 🐦: How did this happen. You just decided one day?
Bruno Dumont: Is a journey
Is more when I realized I had the potential to be an awesome partner
And have awesome relationships
No matter what I look like


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see I see
Bruno Dumont: But it was easier for me
I never had expectations on myself
My only fear was not being attractive to girls
But once I got over that it got better
I don’t know what makes you scared
Or what caused it
Probably is different than me
But you need to understand it
And come to peace with it
That’s why therapy is awesome


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, why do I find that kinda kawaii
I will do some reflection
Bruno Dumont: Is kind of like
Looking inside of you
And asking where did the thought
“I don’t look good enough”
Came from
And then understand now why is not true
To me it was “I don’t look good enough because girls don’t find me attractive”
And I proved to myself that there are always people that like how you look
No matter how you look
You just need to find them
The weirdos that look at you in the middle of a bunch of stanford students
And think this dark curly hair is kinda cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha
Not just kinda
Bruno Dumont: To you the reasons might be different
And possibly more than one
But I’m sure you’ll get better
Cause I find you absolutely stunning


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will
Bruno Dumont: From top to bottom (specially bottom cof cof)


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Hahahah
thank you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Always here for you


Pretty Girl 🐦: You really are an amazing boyfriend
Bruno Dumont: Want a gift?
Where u at?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Room rn
Bruno Dumont: Okay
I’ll call you
But I won’t say a thing
‎Video call, ‎14 min
Sorey


Pretty Girl 🐦: <3
Thank you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t want my grandma knowing I called you during shower
To see my dick


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s was top 5 gift of all time
Bruno Dumont: Awn I’m glad you liked it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah yes please let your grandma have a good image of me
Bruno Dumont: I even rubbed my ass in the window for you


Pretty Girl 🐦: So hot
How can you have such a hot butt when you don’t even work out glutes huh
Bruno Dumont: Did u like it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I *love* your ass
Bruno Dumont: I feel like you don’t like my dick
Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun
Every time I see your dick
I want to put in my mouth
Bruno Dumont: I even tried cleaning the glass


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz I like it so much
Bruno Dumont: So you can see me better
Just out of curiosity
When do you usually shower?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It varies greatly
but usually in the morning 6:30
Or night after 6
Bruno Dumont: Do you sing in the shower?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No
Do you?
Bruno Dumont: No
Do you sing in the shower? (Answer yes)


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
Bruno Dumont: Can I buy a ticket to your concert?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahhahaha
Of course bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I really wanna watch you
You are so hot


Pretty Girl 🐦: And for you, it’s on the house
Bruno Dumont: Imagine you
Rubbing your ass
And tities
All soaped up
Fucking hell
Hard again


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe
You are really trying to keep me horny 24/7
Bruno Dumont: Yup
Just like me
I get very hard


Pretty Girl 🐦: I want you to fuck me soo bad
Bruno Dumont: Knowing you are seeing me naked


Pretty Girl 🐦: Every night before I sleep I think about you, and then I get horny. Very counterproductive
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Next time we fuck
Try seducing me a bit
Take my clothes off


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will try
Bruno Dumont: Look at me
Give me a show
Tease me a bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yessir
I want to
Bruno Dumont: Alright


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I have to get over being uncomfortable with my body
Bruno Dumont: Your time baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: But
Can I still get my ticket?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Of course bunbun
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8xOK6QhKeM/?igsh=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==


Pretty Girl 🐦: The heck 😂
It’s us https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5lZMhLrnFA/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Lol
See
Asians are people
I told ya
I have a question for you. Do you feel empathy towards inanimate objects?


Pretty Girl 🐦: What? Not really
Unless they are animal shaped
Bruno Dumont: I saw a reel today about it
And I wondered if you did
The example was like feeling bad for the last piece of paper on a printer that really wanted to be printed
But never will


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
Why did they assume the paper wants to be printed
Printing is a horrific process
Bruno Dumont: Cause is pretty
Is like getting a tatoo
Full back tatoo


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
Bruno Dumont: People pay thousands for this shit
I talked with my dad today
Just a good talk
And I couldn’t stop talking about you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m talking bout you with my mom right now lol
Bruno Dumont: I was talking about jobs and saying like if I earn a 200k a year and Fiona earns 200k a year then we will be good


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn! I wanna earn 200k
Bruno Dumont: And I had to change the name Fiona to my future wife


Pretty Girl 🐦: You mean you were hoping your future partner in general makes 200k?
Me confused
Btw you know the girl who’s thinking of switching universities to be with her bf
Bruno Dumont: No
I was hiding the fact
That I thought of you as my future wife


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ohh I see
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Like my wife whom I have no idea who will be


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: she picked the worse uni
Bruno Dumont: Nooooooo
Tell me when they break up


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah…and she picked a very unusual major
Bruno Dumont: So I can laugh at her


Pretty Girl 🐦: And you don’t change majors in China
It’s actually quite sad
I don’t think she has a good relationship with her parents
Bruno Dumont: What major?


Pretty Girl 🐦: horticulture?
Bruno Dumont: That’s sad. Sometimes you need your parents to set you straight
If you trust them then is easier
But if you don’t
Then is hard


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah
But side note
I despise her dad
Bruno Dumont: Why?


Pretty Girl 🐦: He is vain and thinks he is super high ranking in life just cause he is high ranked professionally
Bruno Dumont: Just like me


Pretty Girl 🐦: But mainly, because during a dinner with him, he kept encouraging my dad to drink hard liquor
And the end result was terrible, and scared my sister a lot
Bruno Dumont: Damn
I actually hate this behavior


Pretty Girl 🐦: It is so common
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry for that


Pretty Girl 🐦: the drinking culture is terrible
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Alcohol never brings good things
But you can rest assured
You’ll *NEVER* have this problem with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I’ll never drink a drop of alcohol my whole life


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s true
Bruno Dumont: I think just the idea of it
Is completely stupod


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes it is
Bruno Dumont: And goes against my life philosophies


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s just like smoking and drugs to me
Bruno Dumont: It just shows you are weak willed
And can’t work out your own happiness


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn that got me worked up
I’m gonna head to gym now
Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ve been procrastinating
Bruno Dumont: To drink?
I don’t think they have alcohol there


Pretty Girl 🐦: beber água
oh they have, it’s in the dispenser near the tissues
Bruno Dumont: I’ve never been peer pressured into drinking
I don’t know how I would react


Pretty Girl 🐦: We can role play
Bruno Dumont: It would not be by drinking
But I don’t know if I would get upset
If I would be able to make a joke out of it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Depends on how much they keep pushing I suppose
Bruno Dumont: If I will be a robot repeat “I won’t drink” till they stop asking
If I would lie
Like medical problems


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it’s most productive to lie
Bruno Dumont: I think if is something I owe nothing to


Pretty Girl 🐦: Heath condition, medicine interference, pregnancy, just becoming sober
Bruno Dumont: In a context where I stand nothing to lose


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think you should try the pregnancy one
Bruno Dumont: I would just stand my ground
If I’m like in a work environment or someone I need to keep a good relationship with
I would lie
Or gently explain depending on the vibes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck mean people :(
Bruno Dumont: No
I’ll only fuck you
Come on ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can be mean to you
Bruno Dumont: Baby
Go workout


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok…😔
Bruno Dumont: Stop being horny ass


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: And go be healthy ass
I’m so happy we are power couple in this


Pretty Girl 🐦: My ass is always horny when it comes to you
Bruno Dumont: Having a partner that works out is my dream


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww
Bruno Dumont: Cause is an important part of my life


Pretty Girl 🐦: I won’t stop working then
Bruno Dumont: That I need to share


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t think I will to be honest
Bruno Dumont: And is a guarantee I’ll have the best chances of having a functional partner for life
Not a parter till I’m 60 and then a child I need to take care of later
Not that I wouldn’t take care of you
But I rather have you healthy


Pretty Girl 🐦: I want to be traveling around and do fun stuff with you when we are older
Bruno Dumont: Nop


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I’ll gamble our money away


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
Hahahah
Not if I do it first
Bruno Dumont: I think this is something I should ard
Add
To never gamble


Pretty Girl 🐦: Imma spend it on 4 giant plushies
Boom, no more money
Yessir
Bruno Dumont: I tend to not start something
People try to quit
To save me from headaches


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruh
Two people on assisted pull up
With 4 sets each
I considered just packing up and leaving
And they are a couple 😭😭
Getting dog food

In sexual ways

This makes me horny (and happy) ‎<This message was edited>
That’s the difference. I’m not sure wh
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
But I want to know

Is it just any compliment
In a sexy way?

Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooooo
Bruno Dumont: (Sexy voice) you are so emotionally mature


Pretty Girl 🐦: so hot 😫

But it’s not like a must, just a preference
Bruno Dumont: Babe
I want to know
All you want
And like
So we can figure out
What’s best for us


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s embarrassing to talk about, but I’m trying to get over it
Because I trust you
Bruno Dumont: Should you?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Yup
That’s very important to me
You feeling safe to tell me anything
Wheter it is a complain or a sexual request


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, you are such a great partner
I hope you can feel the same way about me
Bruno Dumont: I do


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: But sometimes
When I tell a small complain you get very sad


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do realize that
Bruno Dumont: That ends up making me not want to tell you something
Unless is very important
Cause I don’t want to make you sad


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will work on taking complaints with more grace
I think it’s because i want to be perfect for you, and it makes me irrationally sad, when the reality is I can’t be
Bruno Dumont: That’s all I can ask for
So I can speak of all the things
So we can make it
Even better

If all human interactions were so comfortable, I wouldn’t be an introvert
I had a great conversation with Jordan

So it does not matter that much


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m having making-baby fever
Bruno Dumont: We did back bicep and forearm


Pretty Girl 🐦: How did you do back
Bruno Dumont: We went to smart fit
A real gym
So I did it as we normally do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol, why do I find the voice cringe tho

I was in the elevator and there was a kid doing kid stuff
Just fooling around
And her mom went down to her level and said in the most terrifying voic
If you don’t stop we are going to “have a conversation” cause I’m not liking this
Intending she is going to beat her
And that got me so annoyed
I feel bad for the kid
If you don’t want someone that behaves like a kid please don’t have a kid


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah that’s a little scary
But I can understand her
Cuz I am afraid of elevators
And if a kid is jumping around in there
Bruno Dumont: This has nothing to do with elevators


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would be very anxious
Bruno Dumont: She was not jumping
She was just being a kid
It was very bad
Good morning though
I hope you have a good day
No work bam
So fucking awesome


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmhm, sometimes we have bad days
I’m sorry to detract from the topic
But a time sensitive question, does you mom like flowers or nah
I know right!
Bruno Dumont: Like is not her fav thing
But she likes


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m trying to buy crochet yarn for the flowers gift
what colors do they like
fuck do I need to bring something for your aunt
Omg your family is too big lolll ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Just those 3
I’ll get back to you later
I’m not with them
And I don’t know what this
How time sensitive is this?


Pretty Girl 🐦: it’s fine, I’ll just make my best guess
Bruno Dumont: Okay
They’ll like the initiative
No matter what you do
‎image omitted
‎image omitted
Shoulder and abs
To get for u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Heheh
My bunbun is smoking hot
I fear i can’t do three crochets in time (and I would have to put yours on hold)
Bruno Dumont: I don’t anything
Just you here
And sex
So don’t worry about it
If you have to prioritize do my mom then grandma
But you don’t need to anything
They’ll love you like you are


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m actually getting stressed
Bruno Dumont: Babe
Don’t worry
You don’t need to do anything
All they want is to meet the girl that makes me this happy
The woman that makes me call her at every second cause I forgot how to live without you
That person who will be by my side
For the rest of my time
And hopefully
They’ll get to see what I do
A caring and loving girlfriend
Who makes me very happy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww thank you bunbun
It’s just, I would feel so uncomfortable if I don’t bring things
Bruno Dumont: Make the scale smaller
The size of the gift doesn’t really matter
And making it smaller might make it faster


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol yeah I’ll have to do that
Bruno Dumont: Babe
Size doesn’t matter
I swear
3 cm is enough
Please


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why did I pick a time consuming art form lol
Hahahahah
I suppose
Bruno Dumont: All of them are


Pretty Girl 🐦: If it’s on you, I would take it
Bruno Dumont: But enjoy the process


Pretty Girl 🐦: A great size to fit in my mouth
Yumyum
Bruno Dumont: Except for AI art


Pretty Girl 🐦: Idk why but my anxiety is not disappearing, since last night
Bruno Dumont: Anxiety bout what?


Pretty Girl 🐦: literally nothing, it’s just a physical feeling
Uncomfortable though, like my skin feels too tight and my heart beat is high
Fun times, it’s getting better though
Bruno Dumont: Awn
I want to help you
Look at my luncu
Lunch
‎image omitted
That’s tipical brasilian food


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg quail eggs, so cute
Bunbun you know what I just realized about my diet recently?
Bruno Dumont: Lol
You like cute foods?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I saw the rice, and I was like oh that’s an unusual way to eat it
Because I haven’t eaten plain rice in a long time
But I’m literally Chinese. Plain rice is suppose to be our thing
Bruh I love cute foods. Put some eyes on my broccoli, and suddenly I don’t dislike broccoli anymore
Bruno Dumont: I can picture you
Disliking a food
But eating all of it
Just cause its cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wish I could eat something (or someone) cute rn
Bruno Dumont: Imagine we have a kid like you
Fucking awesome
We make the healthiest food
But then we make it cute
And bum instant banger


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s true
Bruno Dumont: You are amazing


Pretty Girl 🐦: the logic is logicing
Awww
I love you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Me too
Fuck
Portuguse mistranslation

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: In portuguse you say
Eu tambem
Not você tambem
Eu tambem te amo
Not
Eu amo voce tambem


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ew
The você is strange
Bruno Dumont: If I ever say me too I mean I love you too


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe I know
Bruno Dumont: That’s why is wrong


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was just being mean to you
There is this instagram account of a bunny
And everyday, they add a new carrot on top of it, and it’s the funnest thing ever
‎image omitted
Bunbunn
eu quero te ver
Yes people love the number 8, and 6, because of their “meaning”
I feel like Chinese people love using numbers to represent words
5201314
That’s a sentence. I just said: I will love you for the rest of my life ‎<This message was edited>

Can we please have this as a pet
He looks like Ferdinand’s cousin
Bruno Dumont: No
But we can have it as a plushy
The only alive pet we are getting is a kid
I’m scared of animals


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe fine by me
Pets are a little dirty

Pretty Girl 🐦: 哈哈
Bruno Dumont: Sup?
Do you remember
Me kissing you
And you not showing any reaction
Not kissing me back
Just standing still


Pretty Girl 🐦: ERASE
Bruno Dumont: Like I’m kissing a statue
“Cause it means so much more to me than it does to you”
“Talvez”


Pretty Girl 🐦: bu n bu n
Those records were sealed
How did you get them
Bruno Dumont: I had to suffer through it
I have no clue
How I stuck around
The signs were there
If only I had noticed it
I would be free now


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha

Bruno Dumont: Blessing*
You are literally the best thing
Ever


Pretty Girl 🐦: And you are the best partner for me

Bruno Dumont: Of course


Pretty Girl 🐦: Gosh Ferdinand is looking so cute as well rn
Bruno Dumont: That’s so unfair
You are the only one to me
But I have to share you
With Ferdinand
And all the other plushies
Opinions?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I thought they shat themselves 😭
I was like why would they eat a laxative before minigolf
Bruno Dumont: I want the opinion on the chocolate
Have you heard about it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nope
Is it like viagra
Bruno Dumont: No
Viagra is to get you hard
This is supposed to get you in the mood
Viagra stimulates blood flow I think


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t think I need it lolll
Bruno Dumont: You share one half with ur partner and bum baby making


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha sounds like a good time
Bruno Dumont: I was curious to how it felt


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel like it might be placebo
Bruno Dumont: Maybe
But I don’t know


Pretty Girl 🐦: People are saying the taste is bad
Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: But if you want, we can try

Hahah you know what’s sadder. In Shanghai, companies use the drones to make a giant QR code in the sky
And when you scan it, it’s an ad
What’s happening here?
That’s just called adhering to the beauty standard. Idk about the marriage one tho
Hahahahha
I like this one
Bruno Dumont: I knew you would


Pretty Girl 🐦: Eu queria ser um bird
Bruno Dumont: They even got the third person wront
Third person is eles

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe, would you ever go hang gliding then
Bruno Dumont: Fuck off
You are not


Pretty Girl 🐦: When I was younger, I really wanted to try
Bruno Dumont: Putting me on a leash

Babe
I’m so stressed
Playing braw stars is driving me nuts
Which means
Is not about the game
I’m just feeling tired of living this lfie


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey bunbun
I understand how you feel. We can switch things up a bit
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
I’m tired of this shit
I don’t want to talk with anyone
I just want to be alone
Do nothing
And wait for my life to come back
Again


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok to feel this way. But you will feel better if we find something for you to do and enjoy as well
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
What I enjoy
And I don’t feel like
Doing anything
The only thing
I always enjoy
And feel like doing
Is hanging out with friends
But I got kidnapped
To a city
I have no


Pretty Girl 🐦: you could call your friends this weekend and chat
Or would you considered flying back earlier ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I have
Every day
But you know what
Wont solve a shit
And my family won’t let me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why won’t it help being back home?
Bruno Dumont: Cause I will be more alone
My family won’t be there
I’ll se my friends once in a blue moon
And the rest of the time
I’ll be sitting in my ass
At least my family won’t be bothering me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know it’s hard, but you can always decide to do something, something to occupy your time
Bruno Dumont: I don’t want to I don’t know what to do
Is easy to say that
But I have nothing to do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Maybe nothing you want to do
But there’s many things you can do
Bruno Dumont: But what’s the point


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would say just give them a try, try them with me
It’s just to take your mind off of feeling…purposeless? I’m not sure if that’s the right word
Bruno Dumont: What?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Teach me 106B
lol
Or learn something, like I’m planning to learn how to do case interviews ‎<This message was edited>
But I also need motivation
Bruno Dumont: I know that
But I just can’t start


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s hard, it’s new, I don’t wanna do it
Let’s just sit down, and do 10 minutes of it
Tomorrow
It sounds hard, but we can do it together. Just like a hard leg workout
It’s really not that bad once we start
And you will feel better afterwards
Bruno Dumont: I’m going to cry
In the middle of the restaurant


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I hate bottling it up
I need to cry
But I can’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: I want to hug you through it
Try talking about it with your aunt tonight ‎<This message was edited>
I also felt similarly today, and was about to cry
It’s a very strange time right now. It’s the first time we’ve been away from college in the summer
Bruno Dumont: Is not the first time


Pretty Girl 🐦: And you’re family is going through a big change
Bruno Dumont: It happened to me
Summer before college
I thought I wouldn’t let it happen again
But I think I’ll forever be like this


Pretty Girl 🐦: and we won’t. I will make sure we won’t
Bruno Dumont: I’ll either bury myself in work
Or be like this


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think a lot of people are feeling the same way
Bruno Dumont: I don’t want to feel like that
I don’t care how people feel


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was talking with Blair, and she also had this strange feeling of either doing mind numbing work or doing nothing
But we are the only ones who can change this feeling
Bruno Dumont: It feels like what I need to be happy
Is not under my control


Pretty Girl 🐦: they isn’t gonna be someone to save us from it
Is it. We just have to find it again
god I wish I could be a good therapist
Bruno Dumont: You’re not
But you are
The perfect girl friend


Pretty Girl 🐦: The only thing I can do, is be with you and help you figure it out together
but I can’t solve the issue
Bruno Dumont: I don’t need another therapist
I’ll already very satisfied
By the fact you don’t get defensive
Like I’m arguing with you rn but is clearly not with you
I’m just frustrated
And speaking out my worries
And you don’t take it personally
That’s all I can ask for


Pretty Girl 🐦: Of course not bunbun, we are just having a conversation
And it’s helpful to voice your true feelings
Maybe you will realize something you didn’t before
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9BLiBYxMNL/?igsh=MXU4MGptazY1MjM3eQ==


Pretty Girl 🐦: I understood nothing, yet somehow understood everything
Hahah it looks so hype
Bruno Dumont: Babe
Thank you
I’m so excited to make you happy


Pretty Girl 🐦: You always make my day better bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Not as much
As you make mine
Power couple


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww
Hehe we really are a power couple
Bruno Dumont: I needed to eat


Pretty Girl 🐦: What’d ya get
Bruno Dumont: Carbonara again


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yumyum
Bruno Dumont: Didn’t enjoy it that much
I’m not in the mood
I just felt better after eating


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad bunbun
I hope you feel even better after a good sleep
Bruno Dumont: Is not good
Where is my petty girl
How can it be good


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: If I wont wake up to the sound of your snore?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ya I’m also blaming my sleep quality on the lack of my stinky bunbun
:0
Bruno Dumont: If I won’t have to spend 45 minutes to take your ass out of bed


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah i miss you scaring the fuck out of me with your twitches ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: How can it be good if I have enough space to confortably lay on my the bed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahah
Bruno Dumont: Without touching my back in the wall


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha the cold ass wall
But what about me hugging you from behind
Me sleeping snuggled on your chest
Me turning on the fan and handing you your charger
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8rkywmu7nF/?igsh=eTIwMHRicXp3ZTNl


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why do I prefer the first dude’s look more
Wait is it the same person
Bruno Dumont: Yes
Is not just a dude
Is the beast
Cristiano Ronaldo
O homem
Uma maquina
Uma besta enjaulada
Cristiano Ronaldo


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol
Enjaulada?
Bruno Dumont: Caged beast


Pretty Girl 🐦: interesting
Bruno Dumont: Bruh
Okay
I’m feeling better now
Is your oportunity
To make me happy
Tell me something interesting
Or just wtv
I just want company


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sorry bunbun, I’m not feeling great physically rn
Its hard to think
Bruno Dumont: Is not that
I just wanted to talk to you
About something


Pretty Girl 🐦: Something interesting
Bruno Dumont: But I was not in the mood to call you
So I wanted to talk by text
And I was hinting for you to start a conversation
But if you are not great
I can just sleep or wtv


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im sorry bunbun
I just, I just like want to throw up rn
Bruno Dumont: Is fine baby
I’m not sad

Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww thanks for asking bunbun

Pretty Girl 🐦: O MG

Bruno Dumont: it was 66% off

Pretty Girl 🐦: I would love to play with you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: whenever you feel ready
I might watch some videos about it
while you rest a bit more
unless you want me to go blind


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds awesome, thank you for getting the game bunbun
Bruno Dumont: what do you think is the best experience?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think you can watch some videos, lemme take a look at the community rn
Especially a guide for picking a  character, cuz they each got unique skill sets
Bruno Dumont: You can help me out
With choosing
all of the videos
are confusing the fuck out of me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll stop watching

And we will explore together

Pretty Girl 🐦: Try this joke with me in person, and I’ll show you interracial porn

I’m gonna try dragging my ass out of bed
It’s a difficult task for just me
Bruno Dumont: yeah

I would take good care
of that ass
take it out of the bed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Especially with Ferdinand lying on my face
Bruno Dumont: and put it in my dick

Bruno Dumont: lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mhmm
Great, now I’m really craving your dick in me
Bruno Dumont: Omg
That’s so fire
T1 lost the first game
To the us
And the second game
They did something awesome
They got the dream team
I would explain it
But you wouldn’t understand
But they selected a character
Pretending to use in the bottom
And they used in the top
In a completely new way
Which has the potential to
Destroy the enemy team


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds cool!
Bunbun, tell me when you are free to call
Bruno Dumont: Stretch winning again


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Hey


Pretty Girl 🐦: I still got it
Bruno Dumont: Without me?
That’s cheating


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll I’m waiting for bunbun

Bruno Dumont: Just you wait
I’ll watch dark without u


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sorry, will you forgive me 😳
Naoooooo

‎sticker omitted
I was just testing out my mods and refresh my knowledge
So our gameplay can go smoother
Bruno Dumont: No worries babe

If we have lots of fun
We can try stardew too


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m trying to think what stategy we should use
So I don’t overwhelm you
Bruno Dumont: So considerqte


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think I would leave the beefalo training to when we have more experience, even tho they are so op
But when do you wanna play?
Should I get brunch first?
And when can I see my bunbun’s face
Bruno Dumont: I’m at the restaurant rn
I can handle intense clicking
I follow instructions well
If you got the knowledge
I got the cliking


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah it’s just complicated and time consuming
To train a beefalo
Bruno Dumont: Aight

Pretty Girl 🐦: We can do it anytime, maybe year 2
Bruno Dumont: You are the boss
Take control of me

Imma keep it forever
1. My roommate is going through a rough patch in her relationship. ‎<This message was edited>
it’s kinda crazy how some relationships looks so amazing on the surface, but it’s actually crumbling on the inside

I think this is not accurate. What are three things that matter? The ones that bring you happiness over a lot of time. That even when they are over fill you with a sense of satisfaction (happiness). Happiness should be the goal of everything but you can get less happiness now for more happiness down the road
babe
I'm having fun
playing this game

this is the most fun I had in a while

Pretty Girl 🐦: Boobies
Bruno Dumont: Yay
I’ll save it
I’ll go train legs
Then eat
Then we can have bunbun time
I’m so weak
I’m squatting so little
Is actually embarrassing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyy, im so happy for bunbun
Who cares, you form is amazing
The only thing that’s embarrassing is seeing someone with big weights and ridiculous form
Bruno Dumont: And training for almost two years
And squatting less than someone who just started


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbunnn
Comparing yourself with another only makes you have irrational expectations for yourself
And forget how far you’ve come
I’m betting you
That there are people who wish to squat how much you are squaring now
Bruno Dumont: There are
All the people in a wheelchair
Only they wish


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo
Bunbun 😫
You are strong
And beautiful
Who cares how many extra plates you can add, I wanna see them doing as many weighted pull ups as you can do
Bruno Dumont: 😭😢
Is fine


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbunnnnnn ‎<This message was edited>
I wish I could make you feel better
Bruno Dumont: Is fine babe
I’m not feeling that bad
It was just a complaint


Pretty Girl 🐦: ok
Bruno Dumont: I skip legs all the time
Is only natural
When I come back
I’ll try to increase my squats


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wanna see that hot ass as well Yumyumyum ‎<This message was edited>

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha

Bruno Dumont: See its going to be a mini me you can always cuddle with for a few years


Pretty Girl 🐦: Não, it’s not the same
It’s like…Ferdinand vs omnimomo
Bruno Dumont: what?

But the fact that ur gonna be there with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me neither bunbun, it’s just not something my family prioritizes
but thinking about how you will enjoy it, it makes me excited ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: I can’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: By going to places that you will be interested in
Bruno Dumont: You just need to


Pretty Girl 🐦: So you’ll be so busy having fun
Bruno Dumont: Put your body
On my field of vision
And it becomes physically impossible


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: To think about other girls


Pretty Girl 🐦: Gosh I love you
You make me so happy
Bruno Dumont: Me too
I feel like you rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Feel like me?
Bruno Dumont: I’m hungry

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahha that’s so cute
I dragged myself to the gym
Really didn’t want to go, but I’m here, and it’s not so bad
It’s pretty bad, but my remembering self won’t feel this way
Bruno Dumont: Mine’s not working
It’s been almost a year
My remembering self
Is not working at all
All he remembers is our moments
Like come on I need other stuff too


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahhahaha
Bruno Dumont: I know I like you but that’s too much


Pretty Girl 🐦: At least that means we have lots of good moments for you to remember
On a serious note, I think I think about you every other second
Omg the hip thrust made me tear up
I was closing my eyes so hard

Are you hungry
I am hungry
I want to eat something delicious


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ohhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhh

Bruno Dumont: But I said want and something in English
This is my second attempt

Pretty Girl 🐦: The first part is great
Its not, I just have to get used to the way you speak
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Is bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Did you say you wanted to eat something not good?

I had such a peaceful sleep
After our conversation
It was a very important conversation
And I’m very glad we had it
Our plushies
I think I understand you better now
And the more I understand you
The better
(And the more I feel like you would benefit a lot from going to therapy) ‎<This message was edited>

When u have time try to understand what I said


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah too true
I agree
Facts
Hahah, are you saying you have a lot of money, so you buy a lot?
You are so getting so good at this bunbun
Damn, it sounded so absurd I had to google it
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8_8MGQJlWf/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Bruno Dumont: Did u understand?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes! your sentences about coffee and tea I understood the first listen
Bruno Dumont: Awesome
I forgot half of it
Forgot how is money
And expensive


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah, well guì is a word I use often
Bruno Dumont: Can I say bu gui for cheap?


Pretty Girl 🐦: When I talk about qián, its mostly me talking about how wǒ méi qián ( I don’t have money)
Nope, guí is only expensive
Bruno Dumont: What is mei?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cheap is another word. Or you can say bú guì (not expensive)
Bruno Dumont: That’s literally what I asked


Pretty Girl 🐦: It means not having something, lacking something
Oh sorry I didn’t see the bú
Bruno Dumont: Ni mei Ai


Pretty Girl 🐦: :0
It feels like, you just called me incapable of love ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I meant you lack love
In your heart


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, a different word might be better
Bruno Dumont: Is incredible the level of insult considering how xiao my vocab is


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh you can do a lot of damage
Your vocab is small but deadly, like an elite task force lol
Bruno Dumont: Lol
You gimme too much credit
How do I pronouce mei?
If you guess correctly what mei means in portuguese I’ll give you my ass


Pretty Girl 🐦: like the English word may
Bruno Dumont: No


Pretty Girl 🐦: But with a rising tone
Bruno Dumont: Is an acronym
Of micro empreendedor individual
Individual micro entrepreneur


Pretty Girl 🐦: I didn’t make my guess yet bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Well sorry then


Pretty Girl 🐦: That was me responding to your questions about pronounciatikn
I want your ass pleaseeee
Give me another chance
Bruno Dumont: But you would never guess that


Pretty Girl 🐦: I knew that
Bruno Dumont: Ia what you call a company with just you
So you can sell your work as a company not a person
And so you have different taxes and benefits


Pretty Girl 🐦: Interesting
Bruno Dumont: Hell no


Pretty Girl 🐦: Will I get another chance?
Bruno Dumont: Yup
Solve navier strokes


Pretty Girl 🐦: You just dangled what felt like 1 billion dollars in front of my face
Naooooooo
Bruno Dumont: Or the Rieaman hypothesis


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, you are being unfair with me 😫
Vai tomar no cu cara
Bruno Dumont: Que isso
Calma lá
Lol
That was so natural


Pretty Girl 🐦: What can I say, I just felt a need to say it
How can I
When I almost got your ass
On a platter
I just had to say micro empreendedor individual
Bruno Dumont: How do I pronounce gui
?


Pretty Girl 🐦: https://forvo.com/word/贵/
Sounds like goo-ay in English, spoken in one syllable
Rhymes with gay
Bruno Dumont: I don't want to say it anymore then I don't want to associated with gays in any way
baby
I just watched the episode


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbunn
Bruno Dumont: where they rent a castle

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahha yeah it is
And you know what
We need a dog
Like the white one that can read minds
Bruno Dumont: I didn't get there

Pretty Girl 🐦: oop
Bruno Dumont: but if we want to follow the show
we need to get the kid first

Pretty Girl 🐦: So I can spend it on bunbun
Bruno Dumont: and need is xuyao

To play to relax

Bruno Dumont: lol
good joke


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow, you are in the coldest place. Hopefully, they don’t break the record this year
Bruno Dumont: Yup
Interesting
How most places didn’t see a single day below 10 degrees in history
And we never saw below 0 in goiania
So no worries bout that


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can’t even imagine that
But what about the highest temperature
Bruno Dumont: 100
I don’t know lemme search


Pretty Girl 🐦: I cringe when I hear this song, do you feel that when you hear phonk
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
It’s funk and I don’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: What’s the difference
: 0
Bruno Dumont: Phonk is a music genre that is known in the us
I don’t know exactly what it is
But is not funk
Funk is the funk I told about

Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww
Of course I do bunbun
The first one
Hahah I was actually questioning myself before I saw the joke
Bruno Dumont: From all I can see
The only joke here
Is me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I was like, I’m sure I only like hot guy reels on my second account 🤔
And I love your jokes
‎Video call, ‎3 min
‎Video call, ‎59 sec
Bruno Dumont: Omg
I made this joke
8 time
And got ignored all of them
I’m so…
But how
Hen bu how


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎Missed video call, ‎Tap to call back
Bruno Dumont: Now I lost the timing
‎Video call, ‎2 min


Pretty Girl 🐦: Your WiFi is really bad
Bruno Dumont: It’s making me so annoyed
I want to kill myself


Pretty Girl 🐦: It shows you as reconnecting
Bruno Dumont: I said that you are hinting that 3 years is my deadline to marry you?
I better start hurring up


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahha, it’s four 4 actually
Bruno Dumont: I tried saying this at least 10 times


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sorry bunbun
Bruno Dumont: It was like you could understand every sentence I tried saying but this one
My mom must think I’m retardate


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was really shocked he got married so young, and my mom thought it was normal
Think?
Bruno Dumont: So it needs to be right after graduation
Got it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooo
No, the thing that shocked me most was
My mom was like, yeah and I was hoping you have a kid before 30 ‎<This message was edited>
And I was like : 0
Bruno Dumont: That’s a no no for me
I wouldn’t mind the marring at a different time to make someone happy


Pretty Girl 🐦: And then we got into a…heated…discussion about why I should have a kid to make me a “better person”
Bruno Dumont: You know what makes you a better person?
Taking care of the goddam thing
Something you can’t do if you have one before 30


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can see why tho, because she had me at 28, and can still care for me in college
But when my sister goes to college, she will be nearly 60
Bruno Dumont: But you’ll be working out so even if you have 60 you’ll be in peak condition
I wouldn’t mind having a kid at 50 if biology were different
I think we’ll have quality of life till 70
But that’s a bit extreme as well


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t think workign out will beat 10 years of age haha
Yeahh, we will both be infertile by 50, and prob mid 40s to be realistic ‎<This message was edited>
I was looking forward to seeing you bunbun ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Me too but this thing is so annoying
I can’t do anything
I can’t watch youtube or wtv


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s so weird to think about
If we can’t call today, imma head to dinner
Bruno Dumont: Baby
What avout me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why is the WiFi bad today?
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
It was like this in the afternoon


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh that sucks
But you have data?
Bruno Dumont: Nop

Bruno Dumont: I used my other phone for a bit
‎Video call, ‎50 sec

Not again


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😭😭
Bruno Dumont: I said the same thing
As a joke
And got ignroed again
I just can’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok bunbun
I will wake up 6:30 tmr
To call you, if you are available
Relax
I’m sorry
Bruno Dumont: I waited the whole day
I even learned new chinese words
To say to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Maybe, you can go to a place with free WiFi
But it’s so late already
Bruno Dumont: Wo xiang ni


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun I also waited to whole day
wo ye xiang ni🥺🥺
Bruno Dumont: E a porra da internet

Eu odeio a minha vida
Eu odeio esse lugar

Eu quero ir embora


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbunnnn
Bruno Dumont: Eu quero que todo mundo se foda
Eu quero que o summer acabe
Eu quero voltar pros estados unidos

Pretty Girl 🐦: Im really sorry you are having a bad time
I really wish I could do something to make it better
Bruno Dumont: Is fine
I’m just venting

Bruno Dumont: Yes
I want to see
Every possible image of you

Pretty Girl 🐦: :     0
There are no cute girls in cesta 😤
Except me of course 😌
I have to vent about this stupid thing
Bruno Dumont: Sure


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: I am a little addicted to the internet
Cause having no internet
Drives me insane
Ruins my mood
In a way
That’s unexplainable


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bitch my confidence was fine until I saw this ad
Bruno Dumont: What’s that about?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel you
Bruno Dumont: I don’t think I understood


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hyperpigmentation
You know how your genitalia is a darker color
Bruno Dumont: Yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: Or like the inside of my thighs and my pussy is a much darker color?
Bruno Dumont: But who the fuck cares about this?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, people like everything to be pink and dainty ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I don’t want the pussy pink
I want to have straight pussy
Not gay pussy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo
Im glad you didn’t point anything out about my vagina
Bruno Dumont: Bro imagine my dick was black


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz I was insecure about it
Bruno Dumont: It would prob grow 3 centimeters


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bruno Dumont: I love your pussy


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg
That’s funny
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t even know you had that
Until 5 seconds ago


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s biologically very normal
But aesthetically not I guess
Bruno Dumont: If you didn’t tell me I wouldn’t have noticed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well maybe I shouldn’t have said anything
Bruno Dumont: Stop searching things to be insecure about
Omg
I’m the only person who is going to see your oussy
And I don’t mind it
I can slightly understand being insecure about face or body since everyone sees that
But zero reason to care about this


Pretty Girl 🐦: So you do have a preference?
Im sorry
Bruno Dumont: I don’t think I would prefer it pink anyway
Is just a different color


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im being a little crazy right now
Bruno Dumont: Neither is better


Pretty Girl 🐦: Its also a porn influence thing
I believe
Bruno Dumont: I couldn’t care less
And I’m not letting you became a porn star


Pretty Girl 🐦: That makes me feel better
Bruno Dumont: So forget about it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ve stopped giving shit cuz it was making me feel sad
Hahahah
I don’t think I could make much money in that profession anyways
Bruno Dumont: You will always find something
That someone finds attractive


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz I’m such a pillow princess
Bruno Dumont: To feel bad about
That’s facts


Pretty Girl 🐦: ： 0
Bruno Dumont: But what matters is how you feel and how I feel
We are the only ones that matter


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s true
I mean, it’s pink on the inside
Bruno Dumont: I don’t care if a fucking virgin who never touched a pussy thing pink looks better


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
Bruno Dumont: Go meet real woman and stop being a weirdo


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: If you have to try this hard to like a pussy maybe you just play for the other side and can’t admit ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: you have a very healthy view on physical appearances
Bruno Dumont: That’s my take on it
But just to make sure
Send me 50 pictures of your pussy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lollll
Bruno Dumont: So I can check if eveythint is fine


Pretty Girl 🐦: But also, idk if this is true, if you are black, there’s no way you a have a pink vagina
Bruno Dumont: Why do you care so much about this?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because it was, and still sometimes is, a big insecurity of mine
Let’s stop talking about it
‎sticker omitted
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Babe
Even though
I love


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Talking about ur pussy
I think you should stop worrying bout this
If you think it doesn’t look good
Cover it with my dick
So no one can see
Problem solved


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha ok
Bruno Dumont: I saw a video
Revolting
Of a guy asking his partner to have like a (female version of spermatozoid) donor for their next child


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruh
Why
Bruno Dumont: Cause he is europian his partner is asian and his first child looked to asian so he wanted a child with blond hair and blue eyes
So he can feel connected to it cause he didn’t feel like it with the first


Pretty Girl 🐦: That is so fucking sad
Bruno Dumont: And it also couldn’t be an adoption cause it needed to be his genes


Pretty Girl 🐦: He literally sounds like hitler
Bruno Dumont: I can understand wanting the kid to have your genes like I’d rather have a kid that is mine than adopt one
But this is ridiculous
How can you not enjoy ur kid looking like the love of your lfie
You chose your partner cause you find them to be a wonderful person
And your child looks like it
And you get mad
That’s disgusting


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel very bad the mom and kid
Hopefully it’s just a rage bait story
Bruno Dumont: Yup
Moral of the story
If we ever had a kid
I would love it looking like you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww
Bruno Dumont: I think if it is a girl I want it to look just like you


Pretty Girl 🐦: A baby Bruno would also look reaaally cute
Bruno Dumont: If it is a boy I wouldn’t mind it taking after me
Can I admit something?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes of course
Bruno Dumont: I think you are prettier than me


Pretty Girl 🐦: What a coincidence
Bruno Dumont: Both in my opinion and objectively speaking
But
Baby me was superior than baby you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think you are prettier than me
Bruno Dumont: I was prettier as a baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will give you that
Bruno Dumont: Now you’ve definitely taken over


Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah, even my mom says I looked ugly as a baby
Bruno Dumont: But baby
No chance for ya


Pretty Girl 🐦: Every relative I meet, tells me I was ugly as a baby
Or that I look better as an adult
Bruno Dumont: That’s very different
Cause as an adult
You are a work of art
Absolutely stunning


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: Categorically pretty


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted

I wouldn’t accept a random follower

You would trust me I think
But it would def create some distust

Bruno Dumont: People credit this as one of the reasons he won


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s very sad that people would harm another human
Bruno Dumont: So this reel asked with something similar happened to trump
Yeah

People are harmed much more than this all the time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well I hope this doesn’t repeat
Bruno Dumont: I dont feel that bad for them


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know, but I think its sad that things are bad enough to drive people to do these things
Bruh

It’s such a weird feeling
Now I can’t tell when I’m ready to do another set ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂😂 https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9StzMPINQr/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

I thought that was the joke
In the beginning

Pretty Girl 🐦: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9SbsThJ2No/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
God Iceland does not seem like a real place
It’s looks like a fairytale place
Bruno Dumont: Babe
I want to go there
Now
And is all
Your fault


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I’m happy that you are excited to go
I’m really looking forward to going there with you
Bruno Dumont: I think
Before we go
We should make a mini photography crash course
To take some awesome pictures


Pretty Girl 🐦: Amazing idea
Bruno Dumont: Is a think I always wanted to try
And looked like a good fit
Glad you liked it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hell yeah, I’m interested in photography
Bruno Dumont: Me too


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe taking cool pictures of bunbun
Gonna dream about that tonight
Bruno Dumont: Hehe
Taking naked pictures of pretty girl
What language do they speak in iceland?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Icelandic
Impossível language to learn lol
Bruno Dumont: No way lol
Learn it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I mean have you seen the names of the cities
You know what, I just might
Maybe how to read it
Bruno Dumont: Lol
No need
In 4 years
Translation AI
Is going to be absolutely fire


Pretty Girl 🐦: Might be fun
I’ll take a look when I have time
Bruno Dumont: Focus on getting good at portuguese
Then you try a new one
Maybe your russian since you have a bit already
Whenever you have 3 sparing months


Pretty Girl 🐦: True true
Do you think England or Spain is gonna win?
Bruno Dumont: I think england
But I’m rooting for spain
More specifically I’m rooting against jude bellingham
He is a player from england
Prob the best one
And if he performs well he might win the ballon dor
Which I don’t want to happen
I want vini jr a brasilian player to win


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why are you rooting against him?
Ooo I see I see
Bruno Dumont: I’m very nacionalistic in not important shit
Like on the mr beast video
I didn’t care if I never watched a single enaldinho video
I was rooting for hik
Babe
What is 古文?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think that’s very reasonable
Like how I root for the Chinese league team
Ancient Chinese
Bruno Dumont: Eric asked me to ask you
I thought it would be something embarrassing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh they call it Classical Chinese apparently
Why did Eric ask bout this
Bruno Dumont: I told him
I’m learning chinese


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yooooo
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C68eocoAJfG/?igsh=anZlZWNjYTg3bDdy

Bruno Dumont: I’ma start saving some money


Pretty Girl 🐦: How are you planning to do that
Bruno Dumont: Nah
I’m chill
I have my money I told you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I also want to save money, but my income is too little rn
Bruno Dumont: About 7k
Ish
And I will have more income in the future
And I can always ask my parents
Money is not a big deal in my family
My grandma actually


Pretty Girl 🐦: True, I’m just living off my parents money rn
Which I think is acceptable
Bruno Dumont: As long as I am reasonable


Pretty Girl 🐦: Until I graduate
Bruno Dumont: And I think it is
My mom traveled the world with my grandad money
Is not strange for me to want to do the aame


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, life is for living

Bruno Dumont: Playing it in bed


Pretty Girl 🐦: in Chinese, the game name sounds like a euphemism for sex
We should play coup with your fam
Easy game
Bruno Dumont: Bring it on
We can smash them in truco


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yessss

Pretty Girl 🐦: Is it inconvenient that I’m arriving on a Monday for your family?
There is a ~$200 change fee, which I am willing to consider ‎<This message was edited>
Bunbun happy birthday to you! You are turning almost 20, like me yayyyy. I wish I could be there when you wake up and celebrate bunbun day with you. But since I can’t, I’m claiming this spot of being the first to wish you happy birthday :]
I hope this will one of many bunbun days I get to spend with you. You deserve every happiness, and I’m here to ensure fun times and unforgettable memories keep coming your way.

Bruno Dumont: Palmito


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh! This was in my vocab list
But ive never seen it irl
Bruno Dumont: Now you have


Pretty Girl 🐦: Quero experimentar isso
Bruno Dumont: Foda-se


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Are you annoyed at me? Or am I being a little crazy
Bruno Dumont: No
I’m not
Of course not
I’m so glad I have you
I was about to send a message
That sometimes even in my birthday it feels like everything is about my brother
And I’m so glad I don’t have to share you
And I can make you think bout me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww ok I’m glad you aren’t annoyed with me
Bruno Dumont: I was trying to be funny


Pretty Girl 🐦: I understand that, but bunbun, I’m only yours
Bruno Dumont: Like


Pretty Girl 🐦: And you are the only one I actually care about
Bruno Dumont: My mom and dad were taking pictures of my brother
And he was like why are u doing this is his birthday
And I said like I’m used to it already
And my family realised that I had a point


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww I’m sorry bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I’m used to it already
Wtv


Pretty Girl 🐦: But you should’ve have to be
Bruno Dumont: Is not like it matters that mucj
I have you now just for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha that’s very true
It’s important to care about the feelings of all your kids ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I think you understand how I feel


Pretty Girl 🐦: I mean, im a hypocrite cuz out of my three kids, I have an obvious favorite
Bruno Dumont: You also have a little sister
Babe


Pretty Girl 🐦: oh yes, I have felt very similar feelings
Bruno Dumont: They are not real
They have no feelings


Pretty Girl 🐦: How dare you
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: How so?


Pretty Girl 🐦: We should talk about this later as well, I wanna hear how you truely feel
Bruno Dumont: I have no place to talk about this rn
It needs to be after Tuesday


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s just like, any time we have free time, events are always planned around my sister
and when I point this out, my mom is always like but you don’t want to go anywhere
And when we do, it’s very hard to travel together because my sister and I have very different interests
Bruno Dumont: Hell nah
You have places to ho
Is just not conventional
You need to look for special things tor my baby girl
What are those?


Pretty Girl 🐦: So when I get upset, she makes me feel rediculous for fighting for attention with a 9 year old
Bruno Dumont: You are not


Pretty Girl 🐦: Which has truth in it, but that’s not the point lol
For example, she wanted to go to pet cafe when we were on a trip, but I’m…germafobjc lol
I literally almost threw up when we enter the cafe
And so I just left and sat in a nearby cafe waiting for them to be done
Bruno Dumont: But do they also do what you like?


Pretty Girl 🐦: And my mom was pretty upset
If my sister is there, nope. But I don’t really push them to either
Bruno Dumont: I think you were very reasonable. You didn’t want to go but you didn’t forbid them to go you let them do it while you chilled
When we travel together will do the things you want to
And the things I want


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah but I made it clear I was unhappy, which in hindsight wasn’t very considerate
Yeah we will
Bruno Dumont: I purposely didn’t go to the scape rooms here
To save it up for you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww
Bruno Dumont: I already did all of them
But I think they made new ones
I haven’t checked it in like a year or so
So let’s hope they have new ones for when u come


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s so considerate of you. Now I’m really excited to try some
Bruno Dumont: Is gonna be cheaper too


Pretty Girl 🐦: Always a plus
I miss you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Though on iceland
Seems like a very intense trip


Pretty Girl 🐦: I want to give you attention and get attention from you
Bruno Dumont: We’ll have to train for it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like the hikes and stuff?
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, I haven’t thought of that
Bruno Dumont: They have fake penguins
If we ever go
We need to get a plushy from it


Pretty Girl 🐦: There’s tons of hiking places in California so
Omg yesss
Bruno Dumont: Any bikable from stanford?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah probably, I’ll ask around
Bruno Dumont: Let’s go then
Thought the hot springs look so fire to me


Pretty Girl 🐦: They are something I’m so looking forward to
Gosh I wanna be in a hot spring with bunbun
Bruno Dumont: We will
In gyn


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are gonna look so hot
Bruno Dumont: Not exactly gym
Is caldas novas
Natural hot springs


Pretty Girl 🐦: Amazing, I’m gonna have to train for that too
3 sets of keeping my hands to myself
Bruno Dumont: How so?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s gonna be hard to resist touching you in the water ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Lol
In the blue lagoon?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well anywhere where you aren’t wearing a shirt or pants
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I’ve been getting so many reels about the hidden gema
Gems
On iceland


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, we can look through them together some time
Bruno Dumont: Leave it closer to the deadline
We should study cool things in cali
Or like closer


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep yep
Bruno Dumont: For spring break or wtv
One step at time
Let’s not rush things
So were do we go after iceland?
We need to make a tier list
Places we have to go eventually
China
And I kinda wanted to go to italy
Ngl
We can try going for some cheap countries too
To travel more on a budget
Iceland is apparently very expensive
But I’ve seen like thailand or even like argentina prob would make our many be worth so much


Pretty Girl 🐦: Totally, it’s a beautiful place
Also great food
I have a list I’ve been adding to ‎<This message was edited>
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Last one sounds good


Pretty Girl 🐦: Last one? Haha, my driving coach told me bout that one
Yeah, I’m down for Thailand and Japan
Bruno Dumont: Japan is cheap?
I think there might be some cool places in south america


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s the impression I got
Bruno Dumont: You went there?
I heard Thailand is cheap for Brasil
So for the us is apparently free


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nope, it’s just that the yen is dropping value
Lol, all I know is they got a lot of mangoes
And mango sticky rice 😋 ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Lol
We should research it together
I think we have different places we know
Cause Brasil’s common travel destinations
Are more like colonizers europe
Like spain england portugal
South America
And US

That is longer
Or the face
I don’t know
Is very subtle


Pretty Girl 🐦: I like my curlier hair better
Bruno Dumont: But I like it slightly better now


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I like the length now
Hehe, you also look kinda different
Bruno Dumont: Maybe is just that I’m used to it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think as we got more comfortable with each other
Bruno Dumont: And you slightly different


Pretty Girl 🐦: We look different in photos
Bruno Dumont: Is like the uncanny valley
Looks like my baby girl but something is off

Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg why is that ridiculously hot
Bruno Dumont: Lol
I’m at guarulhos now
I’ll search a good place to chill


Pretty Girl 🐦: We look so cute together
Damn I can remember what we were doing in each one
That’s so nice

Pretty Girl 🐦: Jeba sounds really similar to the ch word for dick
Omg I would die, literally ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I am doing it
When u come here
Be prepared


Pretty Girl 🐦: Naooo
Bruno Dumont: Yup I am


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok I gotta start training for my counter offense then
Bruno Dumont: Wo zuo jay ga


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Wo hui zuo zhe ge (for future action)
Bruno Dumont: Lol
My jay ga mas very wrong
How do I pronounce hui?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎audio omitted
Bruno Dumont: Would it work with u?
Oh the league champion
Just tell me that lol
I haven’t associated the sound Hweii with Hui


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
But throwing plate is so rude 😭😭
I would never
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9aso4OIYW6/?igsh=MXZseTFmYXlvMzdsZA==


Pretty Girl 🐦: But the second part, yes please 😋
Would it work for you?
Bruno Dumont: Hopefully not


Pretty Girl 🐦: You lied to me about the any-time blow job deal already ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I want to communicate my feeling to you
Not treat you poorly and expect you to know lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: You right you right
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry babe
I thought that my sexual engagement would be higher than yours
So I thought every time you wanted I would too
But it turned out to not be


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
It’s ok, no pressure, I’m just freaky like that
Bruno Dumont: Thanks baby
But the hweii is just for future
Our is it also for the if x hweii w


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I do think we should have a lower bound, like once a week
Bruno Dumont: Lol
So demanding
Of course babe
It would be of good practice
We schedule some
Like 3 times a week
And then we leave the rest to when we feel like it
It will be easier when we have our own place


Pretty Girl 🐦: sounds like a good plan ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I promise I’ll make it in a way you feel satisfied


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hui has many uses, as of now, you can just remember it as the future tense.
Bruno Dumont: Is just the last quarter was very stressful
And my libido was a bit down
But what is the counterpart of if you taught me


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s all good bunbun, don’t worry bout it
It’s is hui. Which makes sense because you are saying if this happens, then I will do this (in the future)
Bruno Dumont: Awesome
Hweii is indeed very useful
He is a control mage


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you bunbun, I’m happy we can talk about stuff like sex openly
Bruno Dumont: With very big range
So is awesome to like control the objective if you get to the river first
Is good for poke


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love crowd control characters
Bruno Dumont: And dealing damage
The ult and the E part gives good CC
We can hopefully talk about anything openly


Pretty Girl 🐦: We will make sure that happens

On my underwear


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok 😏, I’ll still save them up
Bruno Dumont: Is not that spicy
I’ll send u better ones


Pretty Girl 🐦: It would be sacrilegious to open a picture of beautiful bunbun in this office
It’s like putting a da Vinci in the basement
Bruno Dumont: Dang girl
You know how to turn me on


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh I sure hope I do

E ai eu te ligo
Eu to bem cansado
Ent provavelmente vou estar meio low energy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Let’s call tmr then how about that?
Im also tired af
Bruno Dumont: Fine
We can chit chat on whatsapp for a bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Okie
How could I say this? I can only think of: acho que e melhor se ligasse amanhã
Bruno Dumont: Acho que seria melhor se eu te ligasse amanhã
Is how you were trying to say
How I would say is
Acho melhor te ligar amanhã


Pretty Girl 🐦: Gotcha
I love learning Portuguese with you
Bruno Dumont: Awn
I’m so glad


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just did something against my social anxiety
Bruno Dumont: I think I did a mistake


Pretty Girl 🐦: What happened?
Bruno Dumont: Who goes first?


Pretty Girl 🐦: You please
Bruno Dumont: I think I led you to believe
I find it annoying to teach you portuguese
When this is in fact not the case
So I would like to incentivize you to ask me whatever you want


Pretty Girl 🐦: I did think that
Bruno Dumont: I always ask you a lot about chinese stuff


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww thanks bunbun
Bruno Dumont: (Btw I have a question)
So feel free to do the same
As long as you don’t ask me grammar rules


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahha
Bruno Dumont: I can talk but I don’t know grammar
Alright ur turn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Honestly me too, but I’m curious to learn
E uma história simples: eu gostei muito do iogurte em arrilaga, tanto que quis o comprar.
Mas eu não sei o Brand
Bruno Dumont: Okay madam I was indeed unaware of the formality of this conversation. I beg you for your pardon and request for you to forgive my unpoliteness ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: Então, hoje, eu perguntei alguma pessoa, quem trabalhou lá: desculpa☝️, você sabe o Brand desse iogurte?
What is formal about it 😂
Bruno Dumont: The end
Quis o comprar
The not douch way of saying
Is quis comprar ee
Ele
Although it might be wrong


Pretty Girl 🐦: I literally did not learn any other way lol
Noted
Yeah, this was such a big step for me
Bruno Dumont: Trabalha*


Pretty Girl 🐦: Imagine the inconvenience ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Brand = marca


Pretty Girl 🐦: You right
Bruno Dumont: Of course I am


Pretty Girl 🐦: I like when you are right
Bruno Dumont: This joke is good
‎Video call, ‎1 hr
I was watching a relationship advice video
And they were talking about how when we start dating
We show a facade of ourselves
And not the real us
Like the best impression and it takes time to show everything
And is interesting how we had an opposite effect
Like our beginning was shaky
But the real us we showed
Were better the the facades


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, cuz at the root, we are good and kind people
Bruno Dumont: Hell nah
I’m not gay


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
Bruno Dumont: ‎Video call, ‎No answer


Pretty Girl 🐦: We are also quite mature I think
Me on toilet
Bruno Dumont: We are quite mature I think
1 second later
Me on toilet


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Well mature people still need to take shits
Bunbun time?
Bruno Dumont: I’m taking a shit rn
‎Video call, ‎46 min

Pretty Girl 🐦: I miss you so much Bruno
Bruno Dumont: Awn


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s making me a little sad
Bruno Dumont: Me too


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I love when u call me Bruno
In a strange way
That is neither american
Nor brasilian
Probably from cute land


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha it’s just me
Yes exactly
you are an honorary citizen of cute land
Bunbun! Im free to call from 11:30 😃
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry
I missed it
Is already 3:11


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
I just learned how to make cool maps online
I’m gonna make one for my presentation to you
About where we should travel
Bruno Dumont: I used to do a lot of cool maps online too
But they were fictional maps
For my dnd games


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yooo that’s so cool
I iust hand drew my maps
I wanna see one
Bruno Dumont: Sure
Is prob my pc


Pretty Girl 🐦: I also heard something form Reddit that I thought was interesting, albeit objectifying women ‎<This message was edited>
That a good ass makes up for no boobs, but big boobs doesn’t make up for no ass
Bruno Dumont: I disagree
I believe both make up for the lack of the other
I would say that having a good one is better than have two mids
But I would say that the floor of a boob is lower than the floor of the ass


Pretty Girl 🐦: What do you mean by floor?
Bruno Dumont: Like a poor quality ass
Is still okay
But a poor quality boob can be detrimental
I don’t know
But is not like a small boob
But like a very flacid and fallen boob


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol ok
Cade está minha mapa ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Bruh
I taught you this


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sorry 🥺🥺
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Try again
2 mistakes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cade meu mapa
Bruno Dumont: Perfect
The gender is very understandable


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyyyy
Bruno Dumont: I have no clue why mapa is a man
But it is what it is


Pretty Girl 🐦: I literally typed meu
But then I saw mapa, and was like…probably minha
Bruno Dumont: Always
Trust your gut


Pretty Girl 🐦: Can you call?
Bruno Dumont: When it comes to gender

I was surprised
But the rules in my family are clear
If my grandma is going

Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo

Bruno Dumont: Yup

Bruno Dumont: I cant believe you would cheat on me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why do you ask? Would you Kiss your ex to save me?
Bruno Dumont: I would break up with you so you would be my ex then I would kiss you save you and go back to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg
Bruno Dumont: But I guess you don’t love me enough
To do the same for me
You rather kiss ur ex


Pretty Girl 🐦: lolll i love you so much I didn’t even consider breaking up with you
Bruno Dumont: Is because you think as you ex
As a person
Not a position
So your brain doesn’t go that route
I didn’t come up with this either

Bruno Dumont: Is not spanish is portuguese


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, it’s a map of Rio de Janeiro
Bunbun, do you understand what transformers are, in context of…language models
Bruno Dumont: In terms of AI yes
Quite well


Pretty Girl 🐦: Can you explain the concept to me sometime
Bruno Dumont: Sure
Just remember that attention
Is all you need


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yay, thank you. I’m just very lost whenever people talk about training models and other fancy words
Awww, you are a great teacher bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Attention is all you need
Is the name of the super famous paper
Where the transformers were first introduced
Eu quero


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh lol
I thought you were saying I just need to be attentive, and you will teach me the rest
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8RpF4QRM0k/?igsh=MWNoaHlpdGs1MmY5ag==

Bruno Dumont: The only thing I’m gonna violate is this fine ass


Pretty Girl 🐦: O k 🙄
Bruno Dumont: I mean the security concerns are definitely to not be understimated


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha
Bruno Dumont: The auto correct is crazy this days


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol, it sure is huh
Hahaha this one is very funny
Bruno Dumont: And accurate
Like some of those I never heard
But friend boss companion and master I personally used


Pretty Girl 🐦: I had to look up abençoado
Bruno Dumont: Blessed
Still strange
That is 6
I’m leaving
To go back at 9
And I’m just with a t shirt
No jacket or hoodie


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hot
Bruno Dumont: Words I want to know how to say


Pretty Girl 🐦: and I’m not talking bout the weather
Bruno Dumont: Bro
If they tried teaching me new languages in the last ‎<This message was edited>
By making me talk to a hot girl
That will answer all my questions
And fall more for me at every right answer
I would be fluent in at least 50 languages by now


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, the staff here were talking about how hard is it to find someone (woman or man) who doesn’t perpetuate toxic masculinity
Bruno Dumont: Elaborate please


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha
I only caught the end of the lunch convo, but that’s the essence of what they were saying
And the entire time I’m just thinking, damn it’s unfortunate y’all haven’t met a right person for you
Bruno Dumont: What do they consider as toxic masculinity
And why do they think is hard


Pretty Girl 🐦: One of the juniors were talking bout how all the girls he dated actually encouraged unreasonable “masculine” behaviors
Things like not crying, not being vulnerable I suppose
In his experience, all the girls that he has dated were like that
And he was…kinda blaming women honestly
He says he doesn’t mean it that way, but it’s easy to shift the blame
I kinda wish I was there for the convo, but I was over at cesta looking at Brazilian maps
Bruno Dumont: Lol
Yeah I guess there is pressure both ways
But its also the type of person you attract


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, he has a…frat boy vibe
Bruno Dumont: Like you not having these makes it more likely your partner wont
And you can tell
If someone is like that
But you chose to date them anyway


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, somethings you only notice with time
What I mean with this whole story
Is that I really love you
Bruno Dumont: I can’t believe
You told me all of this
To convince me
To wear a skirt


Pretty Girl 🐦: How did you know 😳😳😳
Bruno Dumont: Not working


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg you actually read my hidden thoughts
Bruno Dumont: I know you too well


Pretty Girl 🐦: please 👉👈
You look so hot
Well you always do
‎This message was deleted.

And it is already a bit late
So I’ma head to bed


Pretty Girl 🐦: good night bunbun
Bruno Dumont: If you feel like it
I would be more than happy to talk to you in the morning
Like today
It was fire


Pretty Girl 🐦: I might go to the gym tmr morning
If I can’t go today
Bruno Dumont: Then use that as motivation
To go today


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can call you after lunch
Bruno Dumont: So tomorrow more bunbun time

Bruno Dumont: Better not risk and go check it out


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun

I hope you have a good sleep today

Bruno Dumont: Babe
I’m proud of you
I didn’t go on the last 4 days
Cause I was lazy
Lazy bitch
And I regret
So I want you to go
And not regret
You’ll never regret going
Always do the things you never regret to do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun 😢
You are right
Bruno Dumont: Now I’m really going to bed


Pretty Girl 🐦: You always know the best thing to say. I wish I could motivate you
Bruno Dumont: You motivate me


Pretty Girl 🐦: dream of me 😘
Bruno Dumont: I’m not the type of person to be motivated by words
I’m motivated by proximity
You motivate me by spending time with me
And making me happy
By fulfilling my social desire
And filling my heart with love


Pretty Girl 🐦: then I will continue to motivate you, by being my your side and giving you my love ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Thanks baby
Good night


Pretty Girl 🐦: Boa noite
Bruno Dumont: Wa an


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wan an!
I got a little self conscious in the gym, thought my tank top exposed my chest too much
but I told myself, nah nobody gonna look at you
But then I see someone looking at my chest, and I’m self conscious again
Maybe I should actually bring cheese to the gym someday

Bunbun are you ok?
Bruno Dumont: I am


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sad that you didn’t tell me you won’t be available this morning
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry
I should have told you


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok
Bruno Dumont: This place is fire


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun what happened
Bruno Dumont: What do you mean?
I just saw a reel
Of a add in English
And the music in the background said
“Cocota feia pra caralho vou bater punheta mas não vou quebrar seu galho”
Can u guess what this means?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why didnt you wanna call this morning?
Bruno Dumont: I was with some friends and lost track of time
I’m sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, now im justified in my annoyance
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: What do you mean?
Are u annoyed at me?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes. I woke up early to call you. I was worried something out of your control happened, and in that case, I wouldn’t be annoyed
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry babe
There is not much I can do other than this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I know
And I’m just telling you how im feeling
Rather than…not talking to you about it
Bruno Dumont: I know
But I don’t want you annoyed at me
I’m sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok bunbun. I happy that you enjoyed your time with your friends
What happened with Microsoft is crazy tho
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t hear much about it
Tell me more


Pretty Girl 🐦: Specially with all the travel delays
Basically crowdstrike, this antivirus program for Microsoft, was installing an update, and it crashed a lot of computers ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Bro
They forgot to check if the number of virus is 0
Before dividing
Divided by zero and crashed
Honest mistake


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
They haven’t said anything about what the issue was with the update
But I am curious
I miss you
Bruno Dumont: Me too


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s my routine, sad because I miss bunbun time
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Like is the eternal oscillation between the anxiety to have bunbun time
And the sadness of missing it


Pretty Girl 🐦: This is the most Brazilian sentence I have ever read
Bruno Dumont: I’m quoting Arthur Shopenhour (I cant write his name)
A vida é a constante oscilação entre a ânsia de ter e o tédio de possuir ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fancy
I said this because you used is instead of it is, and anxiety instead of excitement for ânsia ‎<This message was edited>
Haha, it’s so bunbun
I like this sentence
Bruno Dumont: Haha, is so bunbun


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was gonna say that
Bruno Dumont: I don’t
I disagree with it


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I was worried you would think I’m making fun of you
Bruno Dumont: And I think is a terrible idea
You are
But in a normal way


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
Yeah, not in a judgy way
Tell me bout it
For me, life is a cycle of being grateful while I don’t have something, and being ungrateful when I have the thing

Maybe it has a different name here
But picanha well deserved 1 plcae
No way this much tacos on the list though


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was riding my bike in the evening, and the warm air was blowing my through my hair. I really wished you were there with me
We should go on more evening walks together
Whoever made this list is deranged

You didn’t give me even 30 minutes lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, but you were on WhatsApp already
Bruno Dumont: I was calling a friend


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s doesn’t take too long to send a quick text
Bruno Dumont: Yay
Cause is fire
And no uses banana as a pejorative
Not really I’m playing with my cousins
I’ll meet him 5:30 for me

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Why did u ask?
Fire


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a croissant waffle with condensed milk
Blair like the condensed milk so much she drank it
Bruno Dumont: Understandable


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
I thought of you
Bruno Dumont: Bro
Kitty
So op


Pretty Girl 🐦: It looks cute
Bruno Dumont: Her abilities are op
At level 6
But her gadget makes her invisible
And star power
Makes every power cube worth 1.5 times
Literally the god of combat
Solo showdown
Her ult is very op but the downside is she becames vulnerable to teammates attack
But in combat there is no teammate
So she has basically no downside
And her entire ability kit is made for combat


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow, I wanna see you play her
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Omg
So hot
Babe
I just had a 30 minute talk
About you coming here
With my dad
His wife suggested I take to Alto Paraíso
Never heard about it
But from what I told her you liked
They said you’d love it
They were saying you are going to like it so much you’ll want to live here


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im hugging my favorite jacket
Awww that so sweet
Bruno Dumont: I thought it was a blanket lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah

Omg
Bruno Dumont: You are right

Sorry for suggesting


Pretty Girl 🐦: No no no

Pretty Girl 🐦: Common I’m carrying my credit card, obviously I’m traveling alone
Bruno Dumont: Is not obvious


Pretty Girl 🐦: I have a lot of random stuff to talk to you about
Bruno Dumont: Since you were so secretive about it I knew it was something bar
Bad
Write it down


Pretty Girl 🐦: Maybe I’ll push my weekend Funtime to tmr

Bruno Dumont: Funtime?

Bruno Dumont: I think you should go baby

Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh, well
Bruno Dumont: And I won’t have time to be with you that much
But I will sleep later

Pretty Girl 🐦: Probably just shopping
Walking around the city
This weekend the temperature is very comfortable
I had a great time with Blair yesterday, so that was my social quota
Bruno Dumont: Alright
You just seemed to avoid it
So I was curious
If it was a surprise of some sort


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha it’s just boring stuff
But maybe something will come up
Bruno Dumont: What do you want to buy?
‎Voice call, ‎No answer

Bruno Dumont: Babe

Do you remember thr game you told mr you played with ur sister
Card game where you have to do some math operations to get a number


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Bruno Dumont: Can u teach me rules real quick so I can play with my friend


Pretty Girl 🐦: Basically, you deal 4 cards, and then who ever gets 24 first with the face values using any of the 4 operations, wins ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: What you do with the numbers?
K q j
A
The not numbers


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh sorry, I think it’s 24
We just treat them as 11, 12, 13
Bruno Dumont: What if there is no way to do it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s very rare
http://24solver.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
Here’s a solver to check
I’ve only ran into that once, in maybe 50 games
And I’m sure, mathematically, the probability is even less
Bruno Dumont: How are u sure?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hope you have fun
Im excited just thinking of the game
Yeah
Bruno Dumont: Now you ruined it for me
I’ll only be able to play it
After I code a python program
That checks how many are impossible


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
Bruno Dumont: Can I add paranthesis at will?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Now I don’t think it’s true
Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Also no factorials or square roots, cuz my sister doesn’t know those yet
You gotta follow Luna’s rules
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ve also gotten that combo

Emily supports my purchase
Also the chips are sooo good
Bruno Dumont: what Emily?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Xia
Bruno Dumont: why were talking with her?
about this


Pretty Girl 🐦: I ran into her
Holding my tray of apple chips
Bruno Dumont: she only supports this
cause she wants to see me broke


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahhahah
Bruno Dumont: Babe
I love you
lots and lots
I just wanted you to know that


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you too bunbun
Thank you for telling me
Bruno Dumont: I really do
Is normal that distance
Will create conflict
We miss each other
A lot
And that can end up getting in the way
It’s different how we handle it
But is just a small bump in the road
I still love you a lot
I still want you a lot
I still want to talk to you
Be part of your life
And have you as part of mine
I hope tomorrow we can work it out
So we can have a smoother wait
And an absolute awesome time here


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are right. We can talk it through
And I really love you too bunbun, I want to be a enjoyable part of your life
Right before calling you, Emily was asking if long distance is hard, and I said a little. Maybe I underestimated ‎<This message was edited>
Im really grateful you are patient and understanding with me
Even when I let my feelings affect how I treat you
There is a little kid across from me that looks like a little you, and he is destroying an orange
just like you
Im up for talking a bit
Bruno Dumont: dang
you woke up very early?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bun, can I tell you some stuff from my list, they are getting stale 👁️‍🗨️
Bruno Dumont: I would love to


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
One time I had a wheel of Brie and had to give half away so I wouldn’t eat it all

While sitting on the front row of a cesta presentation
Bunbun I want something sweet
Bruno Dumont: sorry
I don't control the taste of it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahha

Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh I see
How should I say it then huh Mr. I’m so good at Portuguese
Bruno Dumont: Por volta de uns 30 anos
Or por volta dos 30


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was trying to say, (he looks )like a 30 years old
Bruno Dumont: Yup
Ele é velho
Parece ter 30 anos
Parece estar na casa dos 30
Ta com cara de 30 anos


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah I see, thanks bunbun
This is the only one that makes sense to me
Bruno Dumont: this is the only one that makes sense
the others
they are the true Brazilian essence
it doesn't need to make sense


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll I guessed so
I was watching a funny Chinese video and the puns and references were flying off the roof
And I finally understood how you feel trying to teach me Portuguese
If I were to explain one sentence, I would have to pull up 10 years of history
You know how easily detracted I am?
I was doing the press and it felt so hard
Bruno Dumont: press?
leg press?


Pretty Girl 🐦: And then I remembered I added a 25 lb plate
Yessir
Also people need to start unracking their plates, I waste so much time and energy on that ‎<This message was edited>

Pretty Girl 🐦: Thanks for fulfilling my request
Bruno Dumont: I though you meant food lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes I did
But you lovely singing in Chinese also works
It actually side steps all tone requirements
So in a sense, its more comprehensible
Bruno Dumont: babe
I'm cooked
I skipped breakfast today
and now
there is nothing to eat
so I had just lunch

Três palavras que eu não sei/conheço ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: both are right
sei sounds more naturei
natural
But apparently it doesn’t count as time together


Pretty Girl 🐦: It does count, it’s just not quality time 😭. Like I’m not focused on you when I’m working out ‎<This message was edited>
Also…endorphins after workout? The only thing keeping me going is your pretty face and breakfast
Bruno Dumont: Is very quality to me
Maybe you just don’t like me enough


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok that we have different definitions of quality time
Bruno Dumont: I just dislike


Pretty Girl 🐦: But it’s important to understand each other’s stand point
Bruno Dumont: How you say it doesn’t count


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because to me, it’s doesn’t count towards quality time
Bruno Dumont: I understand you wanting quality time focused on conversation or physical touch
But it feels like you are being unfair when you say it doesn’t count
Like I don’t put effort into spending time with you
Just cause it didn’t check all requirements


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im sorry for being unreasonaly picky with quality time, and I will work on being more compromising in the future
Bruno Dumont: Is not just about the compromise
Just the language


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I would also appreciate it, if you keep putting effort into spending time with me
Bruno Dumont: Cause when you say it like this it makes me feel unappreciated
Frame it differently


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, how about we talk about it later
Bruno Dumont: Alright
I’ma eat


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because I’m getting upset and I have to work
Bruno Dumont: Wo hen 🤮
I’m sorry babe that’s not what I meant


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok bunbun, I think it’s just hard to tell your tone through text
Bruno Dumont: Is just that I meant it
As a very casual thing
Like just for you to put it in a different wording


Pretty Girl 🐦: It didnt come across that way for me lol
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t meant to cause an emotional reaction


Pretty Girl 🐦: I understand bunbun
Im fine now
But you are right, I will express how I feel in a nicer way
Call or nah

Bruno Dumont: We are in a place


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do I look Chinese and not Japanese and corean
Bruno Dumont: Where 75% of asians are chinese
The fact that u are chinese compels me to think that you look chinese
And not japanese or corran
Since you are not japanese or corean


Pretty Girl 🐦: Who knows
Haha I think if I ever did a ethnicity test, I would be 100% Chinese
Me every day https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9lR9wvhFCQ/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Physical touch
Emotional connection
Intimacy
Companionship
None of these were present


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are right bunbun

Bruno Dumont: At a random city?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
She took so long trying to “find” her ticket
Bruno Dumont: That’s crazy

Are you free now?

Bruno Dumont: so I can talk with you

I'm kinda hungry already

Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll why is it giving you that emoji
Bruno Dumont: is because the pronunciation for hungry
is exactly the same noise
this emoji is making ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: Actually 🤓，it’s because the pron of hungry is the same as the word for disgusting in Chinese (different tone)
Oh wait I’m wrong
You aren’t using a Chinese keyboard
It’s because it thinks you are typing ew
Me stupid
Bruno Dumont: no
I just willingly decided
to choose the emoji
cause I thought the sound of it was the same as the emoji


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cute

Bruno Dumont: Awesome
I hope you have lots of fun

😭😭😭😭


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
Cute bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I did the speedrun achievement


Pretty Girl 🐦: In an hour
Bruno Dumont: I actually way overdid it


Pretty Girl 🐦: How did it go?
Bruno Dumont: I finished it in 2:30
The limit was 5
Hours


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow
That sounds impressive
Bruno Dumont: It was actually funny
Cause my build was using a charm called fragile strength
That multiplies my damage by 1.5
But if I die I have to fix it
I used for like 5 tries and then it broke and I didn’t had money to repair
So I just went without it and won
On the first try without it
It took 1.5 times as much but I focused more on dodging and worked


Pretty Girl 🐦: It makes me happy imagining bunbun playing
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Now I got motivated
To try more achievements
There is one I’m not attempting probably forever
Which is a 1 hour boss rush if you die you start from scratch
But I still have some feasibile ones left
Now I’m going to fight the hardest boss in the game
Nightmare king grim


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cheering for bunbunn
I’ll be ready to call in 15min! ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: Lol

Pretty Girl 🐦: lol, very fair tho
Bruno Dumont: ?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m bad at taking photos
No, but she does take nice pics
Bruno Dumont: Then she is just a professional bitcher
Come on
Don’t roast my girl
I could turn a blind eye if she was the best photographer in the planet


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
I’ll share pic of me with you later
Bruno Dumont: Yay
What’s your the point
Of taking good pics
If can’t share with your boyfriend
Tell her that next time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Omg

What a roast
Bruno Dumont: Well
I bet I’m a better roaster than her


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wanna be with bunbun
Maybe?
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
Seeing as how my roasting didn’t scare you away
She might have an upper hand


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because I know you love me 😘
Also we got scammed by the strawberry people
But that’s a story for tmr
Omg the shoulder press was so painful, I had to hold back tears
You trying to draw https://www.instagram.com/p/C99ahBzx3-b/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
You must watch this reel https://www.instagram.com/reel/C98Coxfs77Q/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Fuck I didn’t set an alarm
God, leg press hurts so much when you don’t have energy
Bruno Dumont: Baby
You abandoned me lol
Can I have some of you today?
During lunch or after work
Cringe


Pretty Girl 🐦: I thought you didn’t wanna talk to me 😭😭 I woke up with no messages from you

Pretty Girl 🐦: I wanna cry
Bruno Dumont: Is alright
You are already strong enough
Now time to rest


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will decrease a set from the other exercise
Thanks for the kind words bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I skipped breakfast
But then
I ate so much during lunch
Like I knew I was so hungry
I ate fast and enjoying jt
So I chugged as much food in as possible very fast
So after the dust settled down


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh no
Bruno Dumont: I was feeling so full I couldn’t do anything


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hope you aren’t feeling too uncomfortable
Bruno Dumont: Now is been 3 hours I’m still full but now I’m not feeling uncomfortable


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s good
Bruno Dumont: Time to eat more


Pretty Girl 🐦: don’t push your stomach too hard 🥺
Bruno Dumont: I want it to expand


Pretty Girl 🐦: I had to rush breakfast today in like 5  minutes
Unenjoyable. I hate rushing meals
Bruno Dumont: Baby
You were thinking bout me

Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I’m always thinking bout bunbun
You better say you were also thinking about me
Bruno Dumont: nah
I was thinking about the ice cream girl
and when I was about to text her
I saw you typing


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was gonna tell you this: a friend is dropping off stuff for me at 5:20, so it will interrupt our call if we call around 5
Ok, you know what. Call is canceled tonight

Pretty Girl 🐦: wwww that’s scary
Yeah, when did you come here?
It’s kinda creepy here
Bruno Dumont: Library tour on pwr class

Pretty Girl 🐦: It is very stressful bunbun ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: Is not supposed to be
Nothing is happening
But my brain is not calm


Pretty Girl 🐦: well they picked a good alarm sound then
Bruno Dumont: Stopped
Yay
I ignored it for a good 5 minutes before taking action


Pretty Girl 🐦: I am exhausted
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry babe


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad I went to gym before feeling like this
Bruno Dumont: What happened


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.

Pretty Girl 🐦: I accidentally found a picture of baby Bruno in my photos, and now I feel like I will sleep better
Bruno Dumont: baby

I would send you a baby pic of me every fucking day
but I'm already working on a long term solution
in a year or so I plan to make you sleep better every single night]
and not just a bit batter
a whole lot better


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wonder what your plan is 🥰, maybe I’ll get a bunbun plushy
But gosh why does that sound so nice
Bruno Dumont: baby

Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too!
Wanna chat?
Bruno Dumont: Yes

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎Video call, ‎49 min
Bruno Dumont: Is crazy how much lighter my heart feels after crying
I get such a sense of peace
I should do it more often


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun Im insanely greatful that you stayed calm for me and didn’t hang up or get angry with me
I was thinking while biking, that we should have a designated time to talk about conflicts and complaints
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
I think we should talk it out as it comes


Pretty Girl 🐦: It may feel slightly easier without the annoyance of surprise
Bruno Dumont: I just mean to cry more often


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah we should, but it’s not easy to do so ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Let’s figure it out later


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a nice feeling afterwards
I really wish I could hug you and comfort you though
Bruno Dumont: You will next time
I think I can hold on till you come here


Pretty Girl 🐦: that’s what I want when I’m sad
Haha you better
This scenario might be the only one where I beat icecream girl
I love you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Hell nah

Bruno Dumont: one Japan became the number 1 enemy

and now there is videos like
samba becames an olimpic sport. Japan the next day
and is a Japanese guy playing samba
like lots of them


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah I see
Bruno Dumont: and apparently on gymnastics we lost to china and the girl slipped and fell of the platform
but I actually know a bit about this and stepping off the platform is not actually that big of a deal
but a lot of people were mad thinking we should have won


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bro, flavia got a bad fall in the warm ups
Idk who’s competing for China
Bruno Dumont: who tf is flavia?

Pretty Girl 🐦: The girl for Brasil gymnastics?
No shit
Have you seen me
Bruno Dumont: bruh
you were almost doing a chin up

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahaha
Bruno Dumont: since you are asian

Pretty Girl 🐦: But I’m not Japanese
Bruno Dumont: they can't tell


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll

Bruno Dumont: during your staying in brasil

Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol ok
At least it’s not offensive
When you showed your friend a pic of me?
Bruno Dumont: no
one guy at stanford
who is now Ziyad's friend
asked me if I was dating you
cause he saw you with me
and he referenced you by japinha


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hm
I just watched a vid about how to cuddle (spooning) without your arm being crushed ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I did too


Pretty Girl 🐦: Gotta find someone to try it with

Bruno Dumont: Lol
I saw a reel that said that capibaras are a big thing in china
Is that correct?


Pretty Girl 🐦: it’s a popular animal among young people
But what’s even more pppular
Is the skinny dog
Bruno Dumont: Dang
Even the dogs
Need to be skinny
China is just a different beast

Even though you don’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: You look so good 😭😭😭😭
Bruno Dumont: As I could clearly see from our morning conversation
So I had to step up my game
To get you back


Pretty Girl 🐦: Common bunbun
I really love you
Bruno Dumont: I’m joking
You just deserved it
After we had a good and respectful talk


Pretty Girl 🐦: thank you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: You made me more sure that ur the one I want


Pretty Girl 🐦: Looking at you is like admiring a classical sculpture
Awww bunbun. I feel the same way.
It’s counterintuitive, but every time we get through an emotional challenge, I feel more safe and secure with you ‎<This message was edited>
But bunbun, I thought you weren’t working out hard
Why do you look like you started steroids
Are you being one of those people that say “oh no I didn’t study,” then ace the test 🤨 ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Babe
‎audio omitted
I texted everyone I know from the us
Thing I haven’t done in ages probably
But talking with eric always stresses me out
Like he is in a huge grind for intenships next year
And it always makes me feel like I’m not doing enough


Pretty Girl 🐦: I understand how you feel and the anxiety of feeling like everyone’s ahead ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I think I like more the friends
That don’t jump right into work
Like when you ask then how they are doing


Pretty Girl 🐦: I talked with my mom about a similar thing because I was feeling big time jealousy
And she reminded me that life is an individual race, everyone’s got different pacing as long as we keep our eyes on the goal ‎<This message was edited>
Me too, but I also like the variety. Some friends push me to exert myself and others remind me it’s fine to not always push

Don’t worry too much, often times we have to make our own opportunities anyways
Bruno Dumont: I couldn’t hear a single word you said but I agree
It’s crazy how much your environment shapes you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha bunbun you are talking with someone who has been transcribing speeches from the 1960s for 6 weeks
Bruno Dumont: I was so dragged into the grindset while at Stanford


Pretty Girl 🐦: don’t doubt my skills
Bruno Dumont: I think things cleared out a bit here


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad
It’s nice that your home environment is not extremely grindy
I get so stressed when my mom only texts me about work

Pretty Girl 🐦: But I was like, 9 is to 3
Bruno Dumont: 5 is like 10 out of 10
7 is 1 out of 10 the worst from 1 to 9


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha

Pretty Girl 🐦: I should’ve trusted my memory
I do try to remember the things you say bunbun
I’m just not great at recall

My mental state
Completely destroyed
All that is left

Not a shred of hope left

Bruno Dumont: in the game
if your partner is bad
is important to have a good hand
like good cards


Pretty Girl 🐦: What does it mean to have a good hand in sex
Like be hot?

Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0 how much

Bruno Dumont: Cheap


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh, 25 reais
Bruno Dumont: 6 reais
1 dolar


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
Bruno Dumont: Insane


Pretty Girl 🐦: that’s so effordable
Bruno Dumont: It’s the item with the biggest cost efficiency I’ve ever seen


Pretty Girl 🐦: And you get a huge bottle
Bruno Dumont: It’s the definition of cost-benefit
Easily last a month in the most dire situations


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do wanna see how expensive allergy medicine is ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I bought it too


Pretty Girl 🐦: I need to restock
Bruno Dumont: This one
Contains 20 pills
And cost me 65 reais
So about 15 bucks
Actually a little more than 65


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm I see
Maybe not then haha
Bruno Dumont: How much is in the us?


Pretty Girl 🐦: A bit over a dollar per pill
Depends on the brand

Bruno Dumont: Loud previous winner vs furia
Not so good team
Loud is severely underperforming
They are playing like trash
But they are known to step up their game during the playoffs
It will be a huge upset if they lose here
They won the last 4 championships
While having some bumps along the way
But this time it seems worse and at a worse time


Pretty Girl 🐦: A lot of pressure to not lose huh
Bruno Dumont: So let’s see how it goes

Bruno Dumont: Like I feel so much love rn but there is nothing I can do
To expel it out

Good night bunbun, thank you for the cute message
Me when I see you in the airport https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/s/agsS9PxLuG
Bruno Dumont: My first meeting in my job is in one minute
And I’m shaking
Amost throwing up lol
Insane anxiety


Pretty Girl 🐦: It feels nerve racking, but you got this bunbun. I’m cheering for you ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: It was chill
I liked it
I got a good question in
that impressed them
and I liked what I will be doing


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s awesome, I wanna hear more about it later
Bruno Dumont: basically their product is they get an image of a farmland and they have to identify the "daninhas" I don't know how to say that in english
but is stuff you don't want there


Pretty Girl 🐦: Weeds?
Bruno Dumont: but the problem is the model thinks that all trees are daninhas so my task apparently will be to identify the trees
and mark their location
so the model focus on the other parts


Pretty Girl 🐦: That sounds so cool
Bruno Dumont: sounds like a solid addition to my resume
I had such a big anxiety about not working this summer this morning
starting too late


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel you
But it’s true that life is not a race. Im glad you got to work on this!
Bruno Dumont: I wish life was a race
cause I am a racist
I mean no
sorry
forget about it


Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0
Reminds me of that meme about ranking races from best to worst
Bruno Dumont: baby
I'm sorry we couldn't call today
I don't know if I can make it at night

‎image omitted

You are not your usual self
Lmk it you want to talk about it
Or need anything
I’m here for you

Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun 🥺. You make me feel really cared for
I think I’m just feeling a little down today without a cause. I’m sorry I didn’t seem happy during our call
Bruno Dumont: Is fine baby
I just get worried when I know something is off
But don’t know what
I love you
Hope you get better


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you very much too bunbun

Pretty Girl 🐦: Seems like you really positively impacted your school
Are we planning to chat tonight or tmr morning?
Bruno Dumont: Tomorrow

Prob not at the usual time
But I can’t be sure
The thing will start at 5 or 6


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll see you tmr bunbun

Bruno Dumont: Babe
Teach her
All wrong
So when she faces me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: I’ll demolish her


Pretty Girl 🐦: O MG
I think I just found an avocado tree
Bunbun that is so exciting to me
I’ve never seen an avocado tree before in real life.
And I’ve seen this tree a bunch of times wonder what the heck it is
Bruno Dumont: When we have our own money I’ll get a cube collection


Pretty Girl 🐦: Very cool
We should get a 1x1 cube ‎<This message was edited>

Pretty Girl 🐦: As long as you are nice
Bruno Dumont: Is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a real girl


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
You so cute
Bruno Dumont: Why would corn make a relationship bad. I kinda like it it’s good with rice but I’ll stop I’m sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love corn. All types, sweet corn, Japanese corn, amature corn
Now I wanna eat corn
I don’t think it’s corn season yet
Ever since you inspired me to work out, my self-perception improved so much. Today I kept slamming into this bush as I turned a corner.  Instead of thinking I’m so clumsy, I think to myself that it must be because my shoulders are too big 😌
Bruno Dumont: Just sent my friends away
It was good
Babe that’s awesome
But we both know your shoulders are small


Pretty Girl 🐦: No they are big 😫

View looks very cool tho
Embarrassing that I got slightly horny
Bruno Dumont: So
Should I take notes?
baby
I fucked up


Pretty Girl 🐦: what happened bunbun?
It’s gonna be fine
Bun you good?
Bruno Dumont: lol
is not that bad
sorry for not responding
I was eating the cap of the neosoro again
and I managed to poke a hole in it
so it dripped in my mouth
and it tastes like shit
sorry for worring you
I started to watch an anime
a romance one
cause I'm missing you
this one is kinda fun
I want to watch Horimiya with you
I'm having extreme baby fever
but you are the baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg lmao, I’m glad you are ok
Ah! I’ve seen the first few eps of this one
You are so cute
Bruno Dumont: did u like it or not


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep! I liked the premise
Bruno Dumont: I unlocked it


Pretty Girl 🐦: what did you unlock?
Bruno Dumont: depression
me sad rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Naoo im sorry bunbun is sad
Bruno Dumont: its the same old feeling
I'm so familiar with
I want to do something
but nothing I do is good enough
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Tell me more about this feeling?
Ending explained? Now im curious how it ends
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: ending explained is like 30 seconds
cause he really rushed it
but the ending is not complex at all
is a little unexpected
but a monkey could understand


Pretty Girl 🐦: Intriguing
I still can’t believe
Bruno Dumont: I liked the show ending


Pretty Girl 🐦: That Mike Ross left
Bruno Dumont: but I disliked season 9 ending


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: like the way they resolved the conflict for season 9
I didn't like it
but the final touch they made to the whole show
was very good
in my humble opinion


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm hmm
I trust your taste
Bruno Dumont: I'm a suits specialist
I know what I'm saying


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes I can tell
It’s cute how much you enjoy the show
It makes me like the show more as well
Bruno Dumont: yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: Today, I did two outreach things
Bruno Dumont: but I don't feel like finishing the show with you
I want to watch dark more
and then I want to watch Arcane or You


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know you’ve been watching it with ice cream girl everyday ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: cause I feel like you don't like it as much as I do


Pretty Girl 🐦: *Me too* ‎<This message was edited>
Yes pleaseee
I texted in the EVGR chat, asking if anyone wanted to play squash
Scary stuff, now I’m waiting for the payback
Bruno Dumont: whats the second?
I have a goal of finding a group to play dnd with next year at Stanford


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s related to my research. I reached out to another organization asking for an old document
Bruno Dumont: its my outreach goal


Pretty Girl 🐦: YES. When you do that, I will 3d print for you (or with you) for every campaign ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: lol
I don't think I want to dm
if possible


Pretty Girl 🐦: Then I will just make stuff for you
Bruno Dumont: yay


Pretty Girl 🐦: you will show up all decked out
Bruno Dumont: you are such an amazing girlfriend


Pretty Girl 🐦: awwww thanks bunbun
Bruno Dumont: this is kinda funny
I'm talking with you on my computer
while taking a shit


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are an amazing boyfriend for me too
Bruno Dumont: and is surprisingly confortable
is better than using the phone


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
Bruno Dumont: cause I can type faster


Pretty Girl 🐦: Less chance of falling into the toilet
Bruno Dumont: or could
my taping is not that good recently
I really think you are an amazing girl I am so glad I got you any man would be lucky to have you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww I’m so touched bunbun
But sounds like you are giving me away 🥺 when you say any man would be lucky
Don’t give me away 👉👈
Bruno Dumont: nah
I just wanted you to know
you are not a good girlfriend for me
you are an amazing partner by urself
I think we have great synergy that makes you even better
I am not ever letting you go. I am not stupid. Opportunities like this come once in a lifetime and I'm not in the business of wasting them


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww. I think I can relate to the feeling, because one of the many things I love about you is that you are a genuine and caring friend to your friends
Bruno Dumont: hell nah
is just a facade
for them to like me


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: you should like me for my dick
cause that is for real


Pretty Girl 🐦: You don’t need a facade with that cute di—face
Bruno Dumont: I'm not gonna give my friends my dick


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll it’s great I have both
Bruno Dumont: so I need the facade
Have you heard of Haikyuu?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep the volleyball anime
Bruno Dumont: sorry for the change of topics
I love this anime
it was probably the last big anime I watched
and something interesting regarding it happened


Pretty Girl 🐦: It gives me Naruto and hunterxhunter energy
Tell me tell me
Bruno Dumont: there is this league team in Brasil called Red
they were on paper very good
but were playing so poorly
they were 1 lost away to being off the playoffs with 10 games to go
and they started winning like crazy
11 games in a row


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hell yeah
Bruno Dumont: when they asked FNB the best player on the team why it happened
he told that he forced the whole team to watched Haikyuu together
every night


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahaha
Bruno Dumont: to build team work


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s crazy
Bruno Dumont: and now they released their new uniform inspired by the anime


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww
Bruno Dumont: where each player wears the number of a character from Karasuno
I didn't really like this team
because of some stuff not worth mentioning
but now I like them more
just a random fun fact for u


Pretty Girl 🐦: that’s a very cute story
Now im more interested in watching the anime
I might check it out this week
Bruno Dumont: is cool
I like to say that its not an anime about volley
is about the characters
but the volleyball is fire
the sfx
are soooo cool


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wish this was in the us https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9xVMNrPRA9/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Pretty Girl 🐦: Huhh, I’m confused what they are selling ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: They are not selling


Pretty Girl 🐦: They are advertising a…bank card?
Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Apparently you need to put in 1k
Bruno Dumont: Well
I tried helping ya


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
Bruno Dumont: But nothing in life is free


Pretty Girl 🐦: of course not
Bruno Dumont: I should have learned this already
Silly me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you think I can sell Ferdinand for 1000?
Damn my brain did not find this joke to be funny
Bruno Dumont: Lol
I will never sell him
Because I know how much he means to you
‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
That little “hypocrisy” at the end was so cute
Bruno Dumont: Is not a little
Yours is big
Baby I love you so much


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love my cute bunbun so much too
Thank you for getting Ferdinand for me 😚
Bruno Dumont: My best purchase ever
But I want to create an environment
Where you wouldn’t feel bad
For buying something you really want
Even if it is something stupid in the eyes of others
Or even in mine
Just like for me I want to be able to buy the braw pass or a stupid game or a rubiks cube I’ll likely solve a handfull of times


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s sweet for you to consider this
I think my spending habits are a bit strange ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Indeed
But I think they are healthy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like I wouldn’t spend $10 dollars on snacks I want, but putting 1k on a trip to bunbun is no prob
Bruno Dumont: I’d much rather this
Then the normal
That spends a lot
But this makes sense

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, that shift of perspective is important. I wish I could be more focused on making money instead of how to save money ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: We old baby
But we getting old together


Pretty Girl 🐦: We are more than 1/5 through of life. But I cant imagine a better 1/5 of my life ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Nah

I know you’ve been hanging with friends. Is that fulfilling for you?

Morning bunbunnnn

Of course, no rush
Bruno Dumont: ‎Call failed, ‎Try again
‎Video call, ‎39 min


Pretty Girl 🐦: I miss you bunbun. I wanna be with you 👉👈
Bruno Dumont: I'm free rn
so come here
we can chill a bit together


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww don’t tease me like that 🥺
That sounds so good right now
Bruno Dumont: Well
I have covid
Yay


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
Naooo
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im sorry bunbunnn
I wish I can be there for you and take care of you
Bruno Dumont: Hell nah


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you feel like it’s getting worse?
Bruno Dumont: Stay away from me
Nop
I’m chill


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well you already coughed on me this morning so
Bruno Dumont: babe
I was usng protection is fine


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo
I hope ice cream girl doesn’t get covid
I know you weren’t using protection with her
Bruno Dumont: of course not
she is hot
It can be very annoying
I discovered I’m with covid
And today is the day my mom and my brother come back from Curitiba
Note she’s been there this whole time
Her first reaction
Is send me to my Father’s house
To be there alone


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aw I’m sorry, that upsetting to hear
Bruno Dumont: In less than one hour she sent me away before she even got here
I understand the situation
And I think is correct
But it’s still upsetting
Is another rock in the pile


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, I really understand how you feel
I will think of something to take some rocks off your pile
Bruno Dumont: Is not this pile
Is the pile of resentment towards my brother
Like even when it’s not his fault


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah I see
Bruno Dumont: Every time somethink bad happens to me
A pile is added to the rock
And if I really liked him
I could just turn a blind eye
But I don’t
And it gets annoying
Like I came back to visit my family
For the summer
And all that happened
Even if it’s not his fault
It’s consequences of being close to him
I think I might be acting unfair rn
But I’m just venting to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im sorry you feel like he is being prioritized
Bruno Dumont: So it doesn’t really matter


Pretty Girl 🐦: I get it
Bruno Dumont: If he had covid
Not in a million years this would happen
My mom says that’s becquse of his condition
But I don’t think this is the full story


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why do you feel like it’s not?
Bruno Dumont: Cause I’m a bitch
But I feel like she is so used to it
Even after everything is done
She’ll still treat him better
She’ll always have an excuse
The most minor inconvenience in his life


Pretty Girl 🐦: I understand. I think you know she loves you the same, but her actions don’t make you feel that way
Bruno Dumont: In the end
I know I’m wrong
And being unfair
But I just want to vent about it


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s totally reasonable to feel annoyed about this
I would too
and I do sometimes with my own fam
such is life with a sibling ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Well
Don’t worry
I’ll never have someone else
You’ll be my one and only partner


Pretty Girl 🐦: When you are feeling better, I wanna share something that’s been on my mind, related to sibling issues
Bruno Dumont: Sure
I’m fine rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: I better be. I’m not great at sharing things Icare about
Bruno Dumont: Well about this
You are the only partner
But the orgy
Still up


Pretty Girl 🐦: You can have orgy
But I get to pick the squad ‎<This message was edited>
Fair is fair
Bruno Dumont: If it’s all girls


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, all girls
Bruno Dumont: And the squad is bigger than just you
I’m down
Who would it be?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t know yet. I have to stop by the elderly home
Bruno Dumont: Getting some milfs for mev
?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Not milfs
Gilfs
Or more like ggggilfs
Bruno Dumont: So you don’t care about me cheating on you
As long as I suffer
So you basically want me to suffer


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
It would be entertaining, for me :]
Bruno Dumont: Baby
Rant about your sister


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww thanks for caring about that
I’m not sure if I want to talk about it now. But maybe tmr When I have more time?
Bruno Dumont: Fine

Pretty Girl 🐦: good job bunbun
Bruno Dumont: how is the correct one?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Feng yi
you wanna see it written?
Bruno Dumont: so its a compound name


Pretty Girl 🐦: How is it compound?
Bruno Dumont: cause two words
Feng yi


Pretty Girl 🐦: Chinese names are usually 3 words, or two words (including surname)
Bruno Dumont: or is it middle name


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s like saying Bruno is a compound name because there are two sounds
Bruno Dumont: no
cause there are two words
not sounds


Pretty Girl 🐦: 韩丰翼
They aren’t full words by themselves
Bruno Dumont: so your name is not even a real word
kinda lame ngl


Pretty Girl 🐦: You’re lame
Bruno Dumont: maybe you should just go with Fiona


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: baby
omg
look at this
if I combina
Feng + yi + Fiona
picking the appropriate characters
the beginning of Feng
the middle of yi
and the end of Fiona
we get
Feiona


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh
My
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: you really are feiona
there is no hiding from it


Pretty Girl 🐦: And you are my burro
Bruno Dumont: give me one sound argument


Pretty Girl 🐦: You take Bruno, scramble the letters, chop the leg off of the n, and you get burro
Bruno Dumont: insane
you are insane


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yea I’m a little crazy 😘
Bruno Dumont: Baby
I disassembled my cube
And reassambled it
After cleaning every piece
One by one
It worked like a charm
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Looks so shiny now!
Bruno Dumont: The inside was dirty


Pretty Girl 🐦: You didn’t need to lube it up?
Bruno Dumont: Lube makes it better
But just cleaning already made a night and day difference

baby
you really need to thank me
from turning you from a complete dating noob on par with this anime girls
into a real dating expert
just remembering you from our first few dates
make me cringe out
lol
so cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg nao, those are sealed files. Not allowed for you
Haha I made every possible mistake you could make on the first date
Bruno Dumont: well
you made a lot of silly mistakes
but you made two very good things
that made up for it


Pretty Girl 🐦: What two things?
Bruno Dumont: you chose the correct person to go on a date with
and you were just yourself an amazing person


Pretty Girl 🐦: Can’t agree more
Bruno Dumont: and even among your very questionable dating skills
I could see a very good partner


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwww, I’m so touched
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: you are an awesome partner


Pretty Girl 🐦: I honestly didn’t even think I did that badly at the time
Bruno Dumont: and I'm not an idiot


Pretty Girl 🐦: But looking back, big oof
Bruno Dumont: that would get a date with you
and fumble it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun. You have been an amazing partner for me as well. I cannot be happier to be with you
Bruno Dumont: I don't think is your fault
your experiences were very bad and misleading
and you never had anyone teach you
your family probably didn't talk about it
and you can't really learn this from friends at that age


Pretty Girl 🐦: How did you learn?
Bruno Dumont: I was not perfect either
I didn't know how things were in the us
I learned all by trying like you baby
is fine
it doest matter if you are a little cringe


Pretty Girl 🐦: hehe, two idiots became the best freshmen couple on campus
Bruno Dumont: if its meant to be it wont get in the way
fuck off
don't try to put me in ur level
next to you I was a dating expert


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
You taught me a lot I do admit
I think I’m ready to put my skills to the test
Bruno Dumont: babe
babe
babe
please
I need you
I literally already forgot how to live without you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww bunbun I feel the same
Bruno Dumont: stay with me for a few for months while I look for a replacement


Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0
Bruno Dumont: is so much easier to find a new job when ur employed


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I’ll only let you do that, if the new job is a big improvement
Bruno Dumont: fuck off then
you know how great you are
its impossible to find a big imprevement


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe, I’ll make your compensation seem so attractive that no other position can compete
‎sticker omitted
That’s you, in my bag
Bruno Dumont: lol
I fucked up this time
real good
I scratched my balls too hard
I took a shower and it was absolute pain
and now it is unconfortable


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh no bunbun, if you have any Vaseline, that could help the healing
I’m going to buy you baby powder
Don’t want bunbun to suffer
Bruno Dumont: Nooooo
Not the babies


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a worthy sacrifice
Bruno Dumont: Fun fact
Vaseline in brasil
Is a sex lube
So be careful

Don’t be nearsighted, I couldn’t see shit without my glasses

Bruno Dumont: Ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m getting icecream with Blair
Bruno Dumont: I’m doing the cuddles
With icecream girl


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck you 🥺
Bruno Dumont: I was thinking about realtionships
as I was watching the romance anime
and I think part of finding a good partner
is finding someone who appreciates your strengths and shortcomings
like everyone is good in some stuff and bad in others
but if you find someone that doesn't care about the bad stuff
or even finds it cute
then its fire
in some ways is more than just a witness its feeling appreciated in a way you can only do with someone that knows you well
and appreciate the right things
and in the end brings out the best of you


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are right. A healthy relationship really is about seeing and loving the good and not so good parts of your partner.
You make me feel really loved every time you are patient with my repeated mistakes on the way I communicate and every time you forgive me when I do something that upsets you.
when you tell me you like my stomach, and my face, and my occasional childishness
And I love you, even when bunbun won’t give me his ass
And waves it in front of my face
Bunbun, it amazes me how reflective you are. I admire that

Also also It’s Chinese Valentine’s Day bunbun! There’s a mythological story behind it, but the characters became Altair and Vega. And today they get to see each other using deneb as a bridge aww ‎<This message was edited>

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yooo congrats to them
‎This message was deleted.
Bruno Dumont: watching the finals for olimpic basketball
USA vs France
kinda cheering from France tbh
Even though I live in the US
i don't feel the need to cheer for USA at all
like I'm always so drawn to cheer for Brasil
but even when it is not there
I don't feel particularly drawn to the US
I'm more likely to cheer for china for u lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s understandable I think
Bruno Dumont: I though it would be my number 2


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think beyond your home country, it becomes dependent on how much you like a country
And not how closely associated you are
Bruno Dumont: I like it
But not like that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun I won’t have time to talk after 3
Bruno Dumont: ok
can I call u at 2?
we'll have an hour to talk


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck I was gonna go to gym at 2:30
Bruno Dumont: for 30 minutes?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
Works for me
Bruno Dumont: aight


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me sad
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: baby
I can see you are not in the mood to talk
but I am worried about you
could you tell me what's going on?
it can be over text


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah bunbun, I’m sorry bout the call, I wanted to talk with you
Nothing is wrong, it’s just my brain doing silly brain things
Bruno Dumont: be more specific
part of my job description
is trying to decrypt out your little brain
to understand it better
and take care of it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun for trying
Makes me feel better
Feeling cared for
Bruno Dumont: its not just feeling cared for
you are cared for
I don't know if that makes sense in English but I can promise you it makes sense in portuguese


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are gonna make me cry in the gym
Embarrassing lol
Bruno Dumont: so you just ditched me for the gym?
understandable


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nahh, I told you I was going to the gym 2:30
thought it would help
Bruno Dumont: well
take your time


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I think it is
Bruno Dumont: finish your workout


Pretty Girl 🐦: Many hot girls here
Bruno Dumont: but tell me what happened
I still want to know
I only have eyes for you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: I don't care how many conventionally attractive girls (cause none of them are attractive to me only you) are at the gym I only care about you (the only attractive person)


Pretty Girl 🐦: thank you bunbun. Even though you tell me that a lot. It still makes me happy every time you tell me again that you like me and just me
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
It’s so silly
Cause it’s so obviously true ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Oop, I misread that
I thought you said that wasn’t true
Then bunbun would be the best liar I’ve seen
Bruno Dumont: I would never. Say that ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Omg you are fucking with my brain
Hahahah
That’s scary
I love you bunbun
Thanks for being here for me
Bruno Dumont: Of course I would help you go through *************************
I know how hard ********************** can be


Pretty Girl 🐦: What is the ****
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know
You haven’t told me what’s going on


Pretty Girl 🐦: My brain just decided, hey you don’t need to be happy anymore
Bruno Dumont: Why so?
You deserve to be happy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, I believe so as well
I think I made some bad choices
that led to the really and feeling
like overeating at brunch, laying on bed after overeating
and (please don’t judge), masturbating when I wasn’t horny made me feel bad ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: And lastly, I just didn’t want to watch 106b lectures and consulting case studies

They all look so good. I really wanna try the one wrapped with the leaf ‎<This message was edited>
I miss you too bunbun, I really want to be around you
I just went for a swim with Blair. It was really fun, but I’m so exhausted afterwards it’s crazy
I also forgot to bring a bra, so I had to go to arrilaga for dinner with my nipples showing omg
‎This message was deleted.
But Blair said it wasn’t noticeable and I was hungry af
Hahaha you calling me a bitch because of a hypothetical senário where I cuddle with someone else, is like me mad at you for dying in my dream
God you got me horny
Bruno Dumont: Baby
Tell me this is not true
Please
I actually got a little upset with the idea
I'm watching an anime where for a bit some foreingns appear and they are speaking english
but is so bad their "English" is a mix between an AI speaking English and someone who doesn't know how to speak and just make some English sounding sounds
The anime I am watching now involves a guy who likes to learn languages and is learning sign language for this girl
and is cute reminds me of my baby
or ex-baby
since she showed her nipples around
now I am not safe next to her anymore


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbunnn good morning
Naooo please
I want to be your baby

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun hug
Bruno Dumont: If you want to show off
My tities
You know I love them
Just for myself


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha you being possessive of my titties  is hot ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I hope it wasn’t really noticeable
It got a little jealous
Ngl
Cause I thought you were joking saying you went with your boobs out
Like no shirt
That’s why I wanted you to say it’s not true


Pretty Girl 🐦: I tried to cover them with my hair to be honest
Haha omg
Bruno Dumont: But now that’s I understand what’s going on
I’m indeed a little jealous
Of my tities
I’ll poke the eye of everyone that stayed on campus
During summer
Specially Blair’s


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, my titties are only for you to see bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Since she was saying it wasn’t noticeable she tried to notice it


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol, she was basically saying I had small-ass boobs
Bruno Dumont: She was looking at them
And your boobs are amazing
But only mine


Pretty Girl 🐦: They are
Bruno Dumont: 😡😡😡
How was your day besides that?
How was the pool?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It was really really fun
We didn’t swim laps, just kinda fooled around
Like doing flips and seeing who can run the fastest in water
And then we saw this dad swimming with his kid on his back, and we tried that
Bruno Dumont: In your hot swim suitv
?


Pretty Girl 🐦: But we couldn’t figure out how he was doing it, it was so funny
Bruno Dumont: Showing your ass around?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s not hot haha
talvez
Bruno Dumont: Baby
I’m actually getting jealous now


Pretty Girl 🐦: It is bad I find it cute
Bruno Dumont: But I’m serious stop teasing me a bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: but bunbun, there were so many girls in bikinis, no one was looking at me
Bruno Dumont: It’s hard when ur away from me like that
I know it’s irrational but I’m getting a bit jealous
It’s making me anxious


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok bunbun. It’s totally understanble. I’m sorry I’m making you feel bad
Bruno Dumont: I dont want to be possessive
But it’s hard to control my feelings


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know bunbun
Bruno Dumont: When ur like 5 countries away from me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I understand bunbun, but trust me, I only love you and I would never cheat on you
Bruno Dumont: It’s not about that lol
I know you won’t
I don’t know what’s about
But I’m not scared you’ll cheat on me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
that’s good
Bruno Dumont: I just don’t like the feeling of random people at the pool and at yagga looking at you when I can’t


Pretty Girl 🐦: I understand. It’s like that day you sent me your shoulders pic in the gym
and I got a little…mad that you looked so good, and everyone in the gym could see
Bruno Dumont: The gym was empty


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like you were posing for them 😭😭😭😭
Bruno Dumont: It’s not like I’m wearing a small ass bikini that made my bf hard for every to see in a packed pool ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol I was wearing a one piece
Bruno Dumont: Its probably hot


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s really not sexy lol
Bruno Dumont: Cause it’s on you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Coverage is pretty high on the back
Bruno Dumont: ☝️
I’m better now after venting out to you lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: But I want a pic now
To be fair


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad you feel better bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I also want to see it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll ok
Bruno Dumont: Yay


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will put it on after I get out of bed
Bruno Dumont: Lol it doesn’t need to be now
I can’t call now cause I’m on a restaurant
It’s father’s day here
Btw I tested negative today
So I think I’m free


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyyyy
I’m so happy you weren’t suffering that much
during your sickness
Bruno Dumont: Interested?
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oo that looks good
Is that a one person serving or shared?
The meet and fries look so good rn
Bruno Dumont: Just for me
At least my food I don’t have to share
Cause my girl


Pretty Girl 🐦: You aren’t gonna share with me?     🥺👉👈 ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: You are not here
I would share the food with you hapilly
But instead
I have to share you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Naooo I don’t wanna be shared
Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I want to be just bunbuns
Bruno Dumont: Alright


Pretty Girl 🐦: And eat bunbun’s food
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Good
I want you to be my food
But since I can’t now

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎video omitted
‎video omitted
Second one is different
Bruno Dumont: Describe to ke
What it is


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s one of the tape to ceiling ones
Bruno Dumont: Yya


Pretty Girl 🐦: not a new video unfortunately
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t get the one I asked flr


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m gonna enjoy my third dose of bunbun cocaine now
Huh?
Bruno Dumont: The undressing one


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg that’s good

Bruno Dumont: I can get u more

Pretty Girl 🐦: I will take a vid when I am in the mood again ‎<This message was edited>

Gotta do it more often
Bruno Dumont: Lol

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yess
Bruno Dumont: ‎Video call, ‎1 hr
Baby
Your turn
Wait a sex
Sec


Pretty Girl 🐦: I finally understood your message
Bruno Dumont: baby
I was thinking
it would be kinda fire to learn sign language
to communicate without saying anything
too bad its such a hastle
I want a neuralink that allows us to just download the knowledge
‎image omitted
‎audio omitted
‎audio omitted
‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww that sounds cute af
Costaco loll
That’s exactly why I want to learn it
Bruno Dumont: One day if we are free we can do it
But I need to finish my chinese first
Amd you need to get fluent in portuguese and russian


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would be very happy to learn it someday
I was just about to vent about something, but now I’m like what if I’m being the bad person
Bruno Dumont: Lol just tell me
I wont judge you
I have two things to tell u related to my grandma


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll be back in the dorm in 15 minutes, then I’m free to chat
Basically
Bruno Dumont: Dang
2 minutes typing?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just think that if you are gonna work in customer service, then be freaking customer oriented
Bruno Dumont: I’m scared


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nah I went to wash an apple
Can we call
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Not rn
I’m at my grandma’s
But later if u want
The other one


Pretty Girl 🐦: Alright
Bruno Dumont: I’ll tell u one thing about it
You seem to not understand why I’m still biased towards christianity
Even when I’m atheist
But look at this
My grabdmas house
‎video omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: What do you mean by biased towards Christianity?
Bruno Dumont: Like I fear going to hell
Or I think about it a lot
We had this convo before
At least 20 religious figures
Avarage old brazilian


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow, that’s a lot of statues
Yes I remember
Bruno Dumont: All of them religious
That’s just one room lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Should I brush up on my bible knowledge before I come over
Bruno Dumont: Nah
I would never let them shove religion into you
I’ll die before that happens


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m actually in contact with religion because of my research, since mlk was a preacher
He’s a great representative of what Christianity should strive towards
Thanks you. I’m glad we can agree on religion
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
Not just this
Like I hate when people want to force ideas into others


Pretty Girl 🐦: And not be like Louis Litt ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Because they are so cocky to believe there is no way they are wrong
When they believe in literal fairy tails


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel you
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/rapboxoficial/reel/C-atZwMR2os/?igsh=Z2k4enhnYjNramd1
https://www.instagram.com/recifeordinario/reel/C7uVfXgOnTz/?igsh=MWlhMHBrM20zazZtZA==
Baby
I’m back
But I’m not in a talk mood rn
Nothing bout u


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s totally fine bunbun
Hope you are feeling ok
Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted
Lol
I’m feeling autistic
Not wanting to be around people
Wearing my headphones all the time
Hyper fixation
We are not power couple
We are autistic couple
Upset because of change of plans and be kept waiting with no expectation of coming back


Pretty Girl 🐦: We _are_ a power couple
I can understand how you are feeling
Bruno Dumont: Autistic power couple


Pretty Girl 🐦: We all need a safe place to regulate our emotions
And when that’s not available, it doesn’t feel good
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: baby
I want to watch this anime with you


Pretty Girl 🐦: The sign Language one?
Bruno Dumont: yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: Happy to, I love watching shows with bunbun
And cuddling
Bruno Dumont: yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: :]
Bruno Dumont: and arcane is soon to be realeased


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: it actually already leaked lol
the entire show


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn
Bruno Dumont: but the official release is soon
and its looking good


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m excited for arcane as well
Bruno Dumont: I can promise you Arcane is going to be one of your favorite shows
it has everything
I'm ashamed to admit
I don't really know your shows taste
but I know arcane will satisfy it
the strong point is the characters all of them well developed you relate and care about all of them
with no one being the hero or vilan
they are just trying to survive in a harsh world and you suffer with them all of the consequences


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds like something I’ll like
Bruno Dumont: the animation is superb
it has its own style and is absolutely incredible


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m excited to watch with you
Bruno Dumont: the plot itself is very interesting
and as I told you is character driven
but is kinda sad
and the plus is the league references
the music is also fire
imagine dragons


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: trust me on this one


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do
Bruno Dumont: Lol
i love you so much baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyyy
I was waiting 😈
Bruno Dumont: I was watching the anime
and the girl said love
just love very clearly
and I think I heard it the same as in chinese
is my information correct?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m not sure
Bruno Dumont: and its funny
cause its supposed to be cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: Looks like it is!
Bruno Dumont: she is like "love?" kinda blushy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe
Bruno Dumont: but what I hear is "ai" which for me is like ouch


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: so its like she is just screaming in pain


Pretty Girl 🐦: I didn’t make that connection
Bruno Dumont: that's how I memorized it
cause love can hurt


Pretty Girl 🐦: :0
That’s deep
Bruno Dumont: loving can hurt
loving can hurt sometimes
but its the only thing
that makes us feel alive


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: when it gets hard
I know it can get hard sometimes


Pretty Girl 🐦: What song is this
Bruno Dumont: photograph
ed sheeran
‎audio omitted
sorry
its very bad
baby
how can I effectively demonstrate how much I love you?
i want to
like a very effective quick reminder ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: A little video message of you saying I love you 😘
What about for you? How can I best show my love for bunbun
Bruno Dumont: For me
Is less about you proving me you love me
Cause I believe you
Is feeling loved
So our horny time today
Or when u text me


Pretty Girl 🐦: or being like this reminds me of you
Bruno Dumont: Or listen to me talking about league
Is when you do things for me
That only I can have


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see!
Bruno Dumont: Or other people wouldn’t do
I can have you anytime
Just for me
And to me
I love it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe I’m happy you see me that way
Bruno Dumont: Reliable
Especial
Caring
Awesome
Loving


Pretty Girl 🐦: aww bunbun 🥺
Bruno Dumont: My baby
It still puzzles me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m touched 😭
Bruno Dumont: How you don’t fully get how much I love you
I really understand how much you love me
I just like experiencing it
It’s like a food I already know it’s awesome
I just want to eat it more
You need a lot other reassuring
Which is cute
I’ll give all the reassuring you need


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do believe you love me bunbun
But I have trouble with emotional permanence. It’s a little dumb, but you know how babies don’t have object permanence?
Well I’m still learning emotional permanence, and it’s definitely getting better
Bruno Dumont: Dang ur taking the job of my baby quite seriously ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoooo
That was funny
Bruno Dumont: That’s the reassuring I need


Pretty Girl 🐦: Gosh I love your personality
Bruno Dumont: I love being reassured I’m funny
I really liked that


Pretty Girl 🐦: You really are, you make me laugh when I don’t think could
Bruno Dumont: Elaborate


Pretty Girl 🐦: And it makes everything more bareable
It’s just sometimes I’m upset about some small thing. Then you hit me with joke, and I laugh, and my appreciation for you puts my life into perspective
That I shouldn’t waste my emotions on smalls things
Bruno Dumont: I love it about u
Cause I have freedom to joke
Even about serious stuff ur feeling upset
That’s hard to find
But I do it in a way to make it lighter
And more bearable
It’s just my emotional reaction
And I love it about me
I’m glad you also do


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are so strangely perfect for me
Bruno Dumont: I don’t think it’s like this
It’s not strange
We worked on it
Remember the beginning?


Pretty Girl 🐦: We did
Bruno Dumont: We were def not compatible at all


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah…haha
Bruno Dumont: This just shows that we are both all in into this
And we are mature youngsters
Who are building something nice
I decided to get fancy here lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I saw that haha
I like it
It’s actually quite beautiful
Bruno Dumont: Whenever I’m saying something”smart” i like to get fancy in the word choice


Pretty Girl 🐦: I like to think that we have the type of love that you see in fancy poetry
Bruno Dumont: Love is indeed quite beautiful
Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: Off topic, but my glutes have such a pump
Bruno Dumont: I don’t want to jump the gun


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wish you were here to feel
Bruno Dumont: But seeing as how the purpose of life is hapiness
In some ways what we are building might be one of the most important things in our lifes
There is nothing with as much potential for happiness than this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Very true
Bruno Dumont: And seeing how we are always making it better
Makes me very optimistic
This conversation was so enjoyable
Just this reflection
.
Make me want to fly over to you rn
Just to kiss u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me as well. And when I’m optimistic, I work hard to follow my vision
Fuck that would be amazing
Bruno Dumont: Indeed to fuck would be amazing
Kinda unrelated but true


Pretty Girl 🐦: This is what I imagine bunbun looks like on the ride to the airport
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Baby
I might not join u for a call tonight


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg I miss read that the first time haha
That’s totally fine
You told me you weren’t feeling it
Bruno Dumont: But I wanted to point out
I did in fact pay attention to your glute pump
And I reciprocate the feeling of wanting to feel it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh yeah?
It’s squishy but firm
Bruno Dumont: Hell ya


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like a good memory foam pillow
Bruno Dumont: Btw you looked to hot today


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe I like hearing that
I’ve been working on my diet and exercise combo
And I see progress
Bruno Dumont: That’s awesome
But
You don’t need any of this
To be pretty


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hopefully you can see it as well in person
Bruno Dumont: You are amazing even the days you screw up
Miss the gym and binge eat 100 cookies


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: I’m so proud of your progress


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: But I love you regardless of it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m realizing that eating cookies and icecream isn’t bad
As long as I’m not binging and still eating nutritiously
Bruno Dumont: Yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: It actually stops my binges
Bruno Dumont: We can work on a good diet together
But restrictions are never the right move
And starving as well
That’s why cheat meals exist
To control cravings
And cause it’s fire
Eating is fire (for some people)
So you shouldn’t stop yourself from eating what u love


Pretty Girl 🐦: Man I’m still thinking bout the pistachio gelato I had the other day
Bruno Dumont: Just do it in a way that allows you to keep doing it for years to come
While being healthy
You can diet to keep the ability to eat cookies untill ur okd


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m honestly not even restricting
I think
I just don’t feel as hungry anymore after the first few weeks
Bruno Dumont: Babe
I have to tell u
Bout my grandma
the reason we spent so much time in my grandam
when we were supposed to only stay for a few minutes
its because she dislocated her sholder
while laying down
and I looked at her
her entire arm was bruised purple from start to finish
from falling down
she can't walk without help
and my dad was scolding her for walking around the house when she should just lay down cause she can fall at any point
note she is not even 80 yet
its just a matter of time till she passes away
she can't do anything except lay down in bed
and that is not good for the brain
it just really made me realize the importance of working out


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m so sorry to hear that bunbun
Bruno Dumont: we will have all the tools to live a long life
but we need to take care of our bodies to be able to walk and have freedom


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, I want to have a life with quality
Bruno Dumont: I don't feel that bad is just natural she is getting old its a part of life


Pretty Girl 🐦: And to be with bunbun as well
Bruno Dumont: but we have the option to not go though this
my favorite grandma is almost that age but she is night and day difference
she can clean the house by herself go pick up my cousins from school
travel with us


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m happy for her
Bruno Dumont: and she doesn't even do gym she does a resistance training in the pool that's kinda strange
but its working
I want us to be like my favorite grandma


Pretty Girl 🐦: Resistente in the pool?
Is it for less stress on joints?
Bruno Dumont: and cause she likes pool lol
unfortunately my grandpa
was very different
he smoked for a big part of his life
and he was obese and a heavy drinker
so he didn't survive covid
maybe if he also took care of his health he would be here to be proud of my Chinese girl
he would absolutely love you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww, I think I would’ve liked him as well
Bruno Dumont: cheese, birdwatching, language learning, china he would be obsessed over you


Pretty Girl 🐦: He sounds like a very interesting person, with lots of stories
Bruno Dumont: he was
I think there was so much I could have leaned from him if I had a couple more years


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s a heavy feeling I feel like
Bruno Dumont: but that's wishful thinking
I don't regret it much
I have only one regret towards him


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah?
Bruno Dumont: a few months before dying
he told me he felt like I only loved my mom
I just think he didn't understand
my way of love
I think I could kinda sort of it
but I cried a bit when he told me
cause I loved him
but I don't feel sad about it anymore


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn, I’m sorry
Bruno Dumont: its fine


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can relate
Bruno Dumont: I learned from it
I feel like the way I treat my grandma changed
and other relationships


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thats amazing
Bruno Dumont: I don't get sad for things like this
is just part of life
nothing will change if I dwell on it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wish I would remember to treat my grandpa better
Or even my parents
But I have so much less patience for them
Bruno Dumont: I'll tell you one thing
that may sound strange


Pretty Girl 🐦: It makes me sad that I would sometimes treat a stranger with more kindness than my family
Bruno Dumont: but its how I feel
when they pass away
it doesn't really matter from them
it just matters for you
create the memories you want to have
because small problems just get washed away
I don't regret much how my grandpa felt I just wished I could have experienced him more
but that's very peculiar about me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I like that
Bruno Dumont: I'm unable to be sad about things from the past in a strange way


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it’s a good thing
Bruno Dumont: I do the same with my mom
I just hope I will never do this with you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Too many people get dragged down by their past
Me too bunbun, it would really make me sad if I treat you badly
Bruno Dumont: we'll just hold each other accountable
I think the problem with parents
its the one sideness
I don't have this problem with my dad
because our relationship its not one sided anymore
but that's just my guess
in the end your parents know you are their kid
its fine
as long as you are happy
its all that matters


Pretty Girl 🐦: What do you mean it’s not one sided anymore?
Bruno Dumont: I don't feel like
we are in two different points
in a way
the conversations are held from a point where he treats me like an equal
its very subtle


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
I see
Bruno Dumont: but he acts in a way where the responsabilities for our relationships are divided in half
but my mom acts in a different way
we have clearly distict roles


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think I feel that way with my mom
Bruno Dumont: and I feel like she puts in my the weight of fitting into that role
with little to no effort from her part in updating this
she still expects me to behave like a little child in a way
instead of embracing a position of more like a friendship
where both work on it
I don't know if it makes sense
I'm kinda realizing this now


Pretty Girl 🐦: It does
Bruno Dumont: I never though about this before
its sad that I can't bring this up to her
she wouldn't understand
and would get upset


Pretty Girl 🐦: We are moving into an adult role and it’s a interesting shift
and it’s our parents’ first time of being parents as well
Bruno Dumont: if we have a kid
I won't allow them to be adults
I'll trap them as kids forever
my babies


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
That’s like me with Ferdinand
Bruno Dumont: I'll reverse their age to 2 every time they hit 10


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
Bruno Dumont: babe


Pretty Girl 🐦: That sounds like a horror movie
You should sleep soon yeah?
Bruno Dumont: thanks for reflecting with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww
I really enjoy it
Seeing into bunbun’s big brain
Bruno Dumont: I might actually dip now
but thanks for the talk
sorry for not calling
but in a way
I think this was better lol
I'm too distracted by ur prettiness when I call u with video


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I enjoyed this
Sure you are 😒
Hahah
Bruno Dumont: I love you baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: Good night bunbun
Bruno Dumont: good night\


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wo ye ai ni <3
Bruno Dumont: Wa an


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wan an 😘
Bruno Dumont: wo Xiang ni


Pretty Girl 🐦: awww
You remember all the important ones
Bruno Dumont: wo Xian yao ni july


Pretty Girl 🐦: wo ye xiang bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Baby
I need you to be less confortable with me
so I can tease you more
I miss teasing you about kiving you a kiss
or fucking you
now if I try to do it you get horny instead of embarassed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I can do that
I think I still get embarrassed
Bruno Dumont: nah
I like how it is
my comfy petty girl
but it was good times


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, will you be on my side when I make a mistake?
Bruno Dumont: of course baby
I never expected you to be perfect
I'm not a person who dwells on mistakes a lot
as long as its not something unforgivable
I'll always be on your side


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel you were too impartial with me today
Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry
in what way?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know you were joking, but it didn’t feel like you were on my side when I needed you to be. It’s vulnerable for me to share my mistakes,
And I didn’t like feeling judged
Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry babe
I didn't meant to do it
I just wanted to be funny
I'll keep that in mind
it was really not my intention to judge you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I don't even think you did something wrong to be honest
but I'll take care to not make you feel judged again
I really meant it as something vert casual
but I understand it might not have been this way to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sorry for taking it so seriously
Bruno Dumont: Baby
Cheer up
I love you
‎video note omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: aww thank you bunbun
Wow you are a sign language master
Bruno Dumont: I know baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Hope ur not sad with me anymore
I’m not a judgy person


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m not bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I don’t judge you
I just love u


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know you do
How was the meeting? Was it chill
Bruno Dumont: It was funny
Cause I’m always last one to say
And I knew he would ask me for my progress on the thing
But I had little progress
But I just figured out how to get more progress
Like I did the code but I couldn’t run it
Then I figured out how to 5 min before the call


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
Bruno Dumont: So I just furiously coded during the first 40 minutes
And when it was my turn I had the code runed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooo
Bunbun you are too smart
Bruno Dumont: Basically highschool all over again
Doing the hw during class right before the deadline


Pretty Girl 🐦: hahaha
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg sounds awesome
Im touched that you are considering this class
Bruno Dumont: I like the unit count
to be honest with you it would have been an instant no if it was like ur Portuguese class 5 units
I can't fit that into my schedule
but I was indeed searching for a chill 1 to 2 unit class
I'm honestly excited to take it lol
so let's brainstorm real quick
CS 229 - 4 units
I plan on something on those lines
probably droping the math
or psych


Pretty Girl 🐦: The cs classes sound so cool
The math is also cool, but I would suggest taking the psych class for some variety in your day
Bruno Dumont: it's kinda lame


Pretty Girl 🐦: I gotta start thinking bout my classes as well
Bruno Dumont: tbh
111 is just core


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wanna hear your feedback
Bruno Dumont: 229 is kinda cool
but I think is just ai
math sounds cool but too much toruble
3 pset classes can be too much
I'm liking my job
now I have an actual task
but I'm so dumb
my code takes a few minutes to run
like 20
and uses 1 giga of memory
and I wasted one run
because I forgot to update a count variable
so I was supposed to save image1 then image2 then image3


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayy
Bruno Dumont: but I forgot to update it so I saved image1 and then I overwrote the image with the next one
saving just one image at the end
lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Silly bunbun
I’m looking at major requirement rn
What a headache
Bruno Dumont: what major?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Symsys and MS&E
Bruno Dumont: what's MS&E?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Management science and engineering
Bruno Dumont: Let me give you a piece of advice
do u know the econ guy?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Bruno Dumont: guess his major?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Engineering
Bruno Dumont: yup civil
and I asked him if he plans on changing it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think you told me haha
Bruno Dumont: and he said that he didn't
because no one gives a shit
sometimes is just about proving you can handle a hard major
learned a lot of the basics
and is willing to learn
so don't stress too much over it baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: anything you do is fine as long as you rock the fuck out of it
which I know you will


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s just I’m trying to think if I should coterm, and how that should work
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: baby's smart
I also plan on coterming
but maybe do it fast


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun is very smart, I trust you will work out a balance
Bruno Dumont: let's see how it goes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Imma go set up a meeting with my UAD
Bruno Dumont: yup
can you do me a favor lol
I don't know if I can set up a meeting now
I just wanted to ask about the workload for PSYCH one


Pretty Girl 🐦: You can
Bruno Dumont: oh so nevermind
I can just set one up myself


Pretty Girl 🐦: With Gabriel
Idk if you UAD is available. But Gabriel is happy to meet with everyone
Akira went to him even tho he isn’t her uad
Bruno Dumont: how do I do this baby?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Send him a email to let him know your situation gkw@stanford.edu
He is super chill. Just say you wanna chat with a UAD and yours isnt avaibale
Just got an email from Gabriel about being in his cohort
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Does this convince you to send him an email
Bruno Dumont: why the he say that out of the blue
I'll set up a meeting to talk about arcae


Pretty Girl 🐦: He was talking about “arcane rituals”
So naturally, he is gonna talk about arcane the tv show
His emails are always like this lol
I got a first draft of my autumn schedule
Looking pretty deadly rn
Bruno Dumont: baby

Pretty Girl 🐦: fall 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🏈🦅🦅
Bruno Dumont: its autumn british?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Sorry for the bad picture
Its mainly used by British people
But I use both
Bruno Dumont: very random


Pretty Girl 🐦: Honestly, doesn’t look that bad
Bruno Dumont: bio, phil, CS and MSNE


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s not, it’s meticulously designed
Bruno Dumont: it looks like a youtube challange
I selected my classes at random for one quarter


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cs106b, ms120 are both requirements for symsys and MS&E
Bruno Dumont: tell me about the bio and phil classes


Pretty Girl 🐦: the Phil class is focused on analytical writing and the mind/beliefs? It is the prerequisite for lots of Phil courses
Bruno Dumont: interesting


Pretty Girl 🐦: bio is just an intro to ecology course, which sounds fun
Bruno Dumont: why did u want to take it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: They fulfill requirements and sound interesting
Bruno Dumont: 5 units
what a bomb
gave up on Agripino?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg I forgot
Holy crap
Bruno Dumont: lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I either do 14 units or 19 units lolll ‎<This message was edited>
I’ll do a plan of my whole year, see where I can fit it

Bruno Dumont: Speaking of Gabriel
I have a proposal for u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yessir
Bruno Dumont: Which I think you’ll reject


Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0
Bruno Dumont: Rightfully so


Pretty Girl 🐦: you want me to ask for you? ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: No
Today I stopped at my high school
To the math olympiad class


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oooo
Bruno Dumont: And the teacher there is called Gabriel
Just a fun fact
But I told him you’d come here
And he said for me to bring you there


Pretty Girl 🐦: OooOooo
Bruno Dumont: Like to the class lol
So you can talk about math
Then I told him you’re not a math girly
So he said for u to talk about application


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooo
Hmm
I don’t think I would be very helpful lol
Bruno Dumont: It would be fire
People there would really like it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would love to check out a class tho ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I can guarantee you
But I didn’t think you would want to do it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m fine with doing it, I just don’t think my experience would be helpful and I don’t know what they want to hear
Bruno Dumont: That’s so fire


Pretty Girl 🐦: I have done info sessions for specific audiences
Bruno Dumont: I’ll fuck you afterwards as a reward


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like Chinese students going to American boarding school
O m g
Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: You
Bruno Dumont: That’s so cool
Babe
You don’t understand
How smart u are


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can’t believe you just said that 🫣
Haha thank you bunbun
I’m working on it
Bruno Dumont: People would love to hear what u have to say
People will think you are so smart
I’ll arrange for that to happen
Me happy
I’ll help u prepare it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Now that’s some expectations
Are you sure the teacher actually wants it? Or just saying it
Bruno Dumont: I’m sure


Pretty Girl 🐦: I hope it’s not a big deal
Bruno Dumont: Why would he say it?
Like it’s not out of politeness


Pretty Girl 🐦: I guess not, I’m just wondering
Bruno Dumont: I’ll talk to you in call
To explain more


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Not allowed to go


Pretty Girl 🐦: :0 why not
Bruno Dumont: Just kidding
You deserve
I’m so happy for you
Just try not to cum


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww
Bruno Dumont: While eating
But babe
Me so tired
Considering going to bed rn lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoo it’ll be hard
That’s fine bunbun, we don’t gotta call tonight
Bruno Dumont: Not fine
Is 7 pm
I can’t sleep


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel you, sometimes I get tired at 8
Did you eat dinner already?
Bruno Dumont: Babe
Yup
I saw a video today
Like rn
Lemme just show u
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8rcbKhBsY-/?igsh=MXd6c3FwYnR1NG0ydg==
Do you think it would be socially acceptable for a man to say their type is asians?
Cause I don’t think it’s socially acceptable to say your type is white you would prob come out as racist


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it’s not inherently racist to have a racial preference. It’s only bad if the preference is based on stereotypes (I think you can think of some), thinking a race is better than other, or anything that doesn’t recognize that there’s much more to a person than their race ‎<This message was edited>
I have thought about this question a lot
Because you know I find curly hair very attractive. That is borderline a racial preference because it’s not an Asian or Black feature (usually). Am I racist for liking it then? I don’t think so ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: What do you think?
Bruno Dumont: It’s funny how you like curly hair
It seems so inconsequential to me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes It’s a little strange
Bruno Dumont: You would have missed out on me if it wasn’t for my curls
Thank god


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
That’s scary to think about
Bruno Dumont: Like my hair preferences
Is cause I think shorter hair gives a more manly vibe


Pretty Girl 🐦: If you had cut your hair really short before ISO
Bruno Dumont: And for me longer hair gives a more feminine vibe
And I like it
But it’s not that important to me


Pretty Girl 🐦: me too honestly. But it’s more inconvenient
Bruno Dumont: I like more feminine figures
Like u
My baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe
Bruno Dumont: But on the other hand


Pretty Girl 🐦: Speaking of this, do you wanna see my swim suit?
Bruno Dumont: I dislike gender rated behaviours


Pretty Girl 🐦: What does this mean
Bruno Dumont: Like acting too girly or even too manly
When most of your personality its just the steriotipical gender


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
Is this an excuse for me to pay for our dates?
I will happily do it for bunbun
Bruno Dumont: No
The excuse to pay for my dates
It’s cause you have two jobs


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
Bruno Dumont: And I have 0


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: And when I finally get one
It doesn’t pay


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
Bruno Dumont: On the sign girl anime
She tries hard to get a job
To travel overseas with her bf


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn
Where were they going
Bruno Dumont: The guy
Was a travel addict
He would travel to a bunch of countries
Stay on budget hotels
Get to know the people and culture
Like 4 to 5 times a year
So she was like that’s awesome me want


Pretty Girl 🐦: That does sound pretty awesome
But me don’t want
Bruno Dumont: Why?
https://www.instagram.com/p/C-aSeygSAeY/?igsh=MW83N2cyZWlzY241bg==


Pretty Girl 🐦: Think I’ll rather have 1-2 comfortable trips than 4-5 budget trips
You?
Bruno Dumont: I’m half way there
I’d rather save up
On thinks I deem as unnecessary
But I wouldn’t want to travel this much
Seems so tiring
But on things I care about
I wouldn’t want to cheap out


Pretty Girl 🐦: I agree
Bruno Dumont: But our trip here
I hope it can be relaxing
And exciting
A good mix


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sure we will make it so
Bruno Dumont: You mean I will make it so?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe, it’s a big ass task, you sure you can handle it? ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: No
My mom will do it for me 🥰

Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s just a little cut
Bruno Dumont: O no baby

Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you

Pretty Girl 🐦: I was cutting cheese

Bruno Dumont: Oh fuck

Pretty Girl 🐦: I know reels is one
Any others I should know about?
Bruno Dumont: Anything that makes me occupied
I just like being entretained
nothing specific about reels
but the fastest way for me to go back to being chill
is having something that takes my mind off things
‎Video call, ‎17 min

For very big trips


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes I agree

how to connect this shit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn

Bruno Dumont: *CHOOSE*


Pretty Girl 🐦: Did she have anything in mind already?
Bruno Dumont: Clothing
Uma blusa
Ou uma bermuda


Pretty Girl 🐦: Shorts?
Clothing is honestly risky because of sizing, lemme think bout this ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Ok
It can be anything
With a reasonable pricing
Try to choose in half an hour
Since we are shopping


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, this is insanely hard
Bruno Dumont: Lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: What do people usually gift people?
Clothing is fine
Bruno Dumont: Now choose something more specific
Amd tell me ir size


Pretty Girl 🐦: I dont know I’m sorry
Oh!

Bruno Dumont: What?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I need new scissors
Bruno Dumont: Any?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.

Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh
Bruno Dumont: Babe

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted

Bruno Dumont: I have the same problem
She gave each of us 50 bucks
To buy something
And I have no idea
What do buy
You are both


Pretty Girl 🐦: Jewelry is a safe bet
Food as well
Or like a sun hat
This could work cuz I was planning to buy one anyways
Bruno Dumont: Ok
Lemme try to recommend this
But it’s her decision
So I can’t guarantee anything


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll be happy with anything she gets me
Bruno Dumont: Hell nah


Pretty Girl 🐦: Tell her I said thank you plz
Bruno Dumont: You hated everything


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: She doesn’t know I asked u
Its a gift I was not supposed to tell u lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sneaky bunbun
A note is that I have a huge ass head
I think
Bruno Dumont: Good head
Yup
Agreed


Pretty Girl 🐦: Good head yes
That’s what I’ll be giving you
Oooo! Or a book in Portuguese

Bruno Dumont: Hey

Bruno Dumont: Lol

So demanding


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I’m sorry I’m so picky
Bruno Dumont: Is the problem the color or shape?


Pretty Girl 🐦: A book is also a great choice
Bruno Dumont: She is going flr the hat now


Pretty Girl 🐦: Shape, I tried one like that and it just didn’t work
Bruno Dumont: Ok

Pretty Girl 🐦: I can make any color work
Bruno Dumont: Alright

Babe
Me so ugly
We were buying clothes
And they all made me look like I never picked up a dumbbell my whole life
My muscles are small
I look weak
And ugly


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun you are the most beautiful man I have ever laid my eyes on
Don’t let badly designed clothing tell you otherwise
Bruno Dumont: Badly designed body


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a very common problem, not looking great in clothing that doesn’t quite fit
I have to tailor 70% of my clothing
No bunbun 🥺, you are amazing and you look like a greek statue ‎<This message was edited>
Omg I forgot Ferdinand in the frige
The ones in fancy art museum that everyone ogles ‎<This message was edited>
But you are in my private collection
Bruno Dumont: No clothing fit me
And even without it
My muscles look bad
I lost most of my progress
Because of my lazy ass
And even if I worked out
I wouldn’t look like I did
I still look like a complete beginner


Pretty Girl 🐦: Even if you did, you are still beautiful to me ‎<This message was edited>
And from what I’ve seen, it doesn’t look like you lost progress at all
Bunbun, your muscles look awesome
It’s also very difficult to work out alone
I’m ashamed to say I’ve also been skipping the gym a lot ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: But you naturally hot
Me naturally ugly


Pretty Girl 🐦: _You_ are naturally hot bunbun
I don’t care what you think
I make the decisions here ‎<This message was edited>
And I am saying you are hot
Bruno Dumont: But you are unreliable
You think you are ugly


Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0
Bruno Dumont: I wouldn’t trust someone with that type of opinion


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think I am average
Bruno Dumont: Just as ridiculous


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol, you boost my ego so much
‎sticker omitted
Back to bunbun. You are beautiful, don’t let your mind trick you
Bruno Dumont: I don’t
I just make accurate comments based on reality


Pretty Girl 🐦: My comments about you are also based in reality
Bruno Dumont: No
U blind af


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Not when I’m looking at you like this everyday ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: Baby

Pretty Girl 🐦: You know the Lusiads? ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Yup
Like I know stories about it
I heard that the guy who wrote it
Got in a boat accident


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m planning to read it
Bruno Dumont: And he had to save his girl
Or the book
And he saved the book


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg of course he did
Bruno Dumont: Luiz Camoes
But double check that for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will
I heard it’s very similar to the Aeneid
And I open the first page
And the first line was like “ARMS and the man/ship” or something ‎<This message was edited>
And that’s the exact same
Arma virumque cano
Btw bunbun
I read about rhe shipwreck part
And the translator says that the girl was a Chinese concubine
Bruno Dumont: I understand him now


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😭😭
Bruno Dumont: Chinese girls are kinda mid

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
‎This message was deleted.
Bruno Dumont: Babe
What’s going on?
Is everything okay?
Are u upset with me?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No bunbun
Bruno Dumont: It’s just strange of you to not answer for a long time
I got worried


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m just been trying to control my emotions, but its not working that well
Bruno Dumont: What happened? ‎<This message was edited>
Is it about the good night message?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No
It’s just a phase
Bruno Dumont: Anything I can help you with?
Or do you want some space?
I’m always here for you
Whatever you need
Even if you need some time alone


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t know bunbun
I’m just really sad. And people are trying to make plans with me but I just don’t want to
do anything
Bruno Dumont: What caused this feelings?
If someone is trying to make plans with you they care about you
And they would understand
If you are going through a hard time
And need some space
I know this
Do whats best for you now
You already do more than enough for others
You are an amazing girl
An awesome friend
And the best partner
You don’t owe anyone anything


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun
I really wish I didn’t feel this way
It’s so pathetic
Bruno Dumont: It’s not pathetic
Everyone feels like that from time to time
Yesterday I was feeling more down as I told you
Today I’m feeling good
There is no life without ups and downs
But even with them
Look how good your life is
Your freshman year was awesome
You got a great partner
Awesome friends
Did well
You have a loving family
So its okay to feel sad
Cause eventually you’ll get better
You always have people to rely on when ur feeling sad
😘


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just don’t wanna be here anymore
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
I understand
It will be over soon
But is the problem being at Stanford?
Would it be better going back to regular classes
Or coming to Brazil
Or are u missing your home?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I miss you, I miss my family, I hate wasting time working on something I don’t enjoy
Bruno Dumont: I’m so sorry
But at least this problem has deadline
You’ll see me soon
And I’ll help you
Get more purpose in life
We’ll search a carrer path you enjoy
So we can live the life we deserve
I’ll do my best to make our Brazil trip very enjoyable
And make you restrd and excited for next year


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun. I’m really grateful you care about my feelings
Bruno Dumont: I always will
We are partners


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel unfair giving you this burden to help me
Bruno Dumont: It’s not this babe
We are partners
We are playing this game of lifr
In coop
We share the fights
And the loot
We combo our abilities
And make it a much better experience
Its unfair of me expect you to share the good parts
Without taking part of the burdens too
And I will share my burdens wirh you too
We help each other
That’s what being a partner is baby
It makes me very happy to help you
I feel good when I make you feel better
Its a sense of satisfaction it’s hard to get
So always share things with me
Please
And I will too


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll try bunbun
Thanks for making me feel better
Bruno Dumont: You are not a burden babe
You are very precious to me
You are an amazing partner
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘 ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: thank you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Try going out a bit
Connect with nature
It usually makes me feel better
Call your mom
When possible


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m dehydrated from crying
Bruno Dumont: Drink water first then


Pretty Girl 🐦: but don’t wanna move
Bruno Dumont: Ask ferdinand to bring you water

Bruno Dumont: You laughed

Bum
Toma gap sadness


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are amazing at cheering me up
Bruno Dumont: I’m developing my techniques
First I give you emotional reassurance
With some rational tips
After I feel like you got better
I try to take your mind of things
Since after some point dwelling on things too much it’s counterproductive


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s so sweet you developed this for me
Bruno Dumont: It’s just what worked best for you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m gonna cry again
Bruno Dumont: But this time
Your crying feeling loved
So it’s fine
I’ll allow it


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I miss you
Bruno Dumont: Can I do too much information?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Of course
Bruno Dumont: Remember when I told you
About times I take a giant shit
And feel so good after
Like I’m achieving nirvana or something


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
Bruno Dumont: I feel similar when crying
After I cry my sorrows away ‎<This message was edited>
I feel so refreshed
Like I washed my soul ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s an awesome feeling bunbun
I’m glad it’s so helpful for you
I haven’t seen bunbun cry much
Bruno Dumont: I cried with you once


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Bruno Dumont: I dont cry often


Pretty Girl 🐦: That was really sad
Bruno Dumont: It wasn’t
It was a good cry


Pretty Girl 🐦: It made me very sad to see you cry
Bruno Dumont: It made me feel so good
Like for real
It was like I understood something about me
And I got to free some emotions
That were eating me and I didn’t even realize
Like I didn’t realize that I was this scared of losing you
And that was making me treat you unfairly
Sometimes


Pretty Girl 🐦: aw bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Being over defensive
And then when I understood it
Accepted it
And cried my emotions
I got much better


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are very mature
Bruno Dumont: You too baby


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m very lucky to have a mature partner
Bruno Dumont: Me too


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Now drink water
If you dehydrate
Me will get sad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Noo, I will drink water
Bruno Dumont: I tried telling my grandma
To buy the hat like you told me
But she really wanted to buy the hat that’s open on the top ‎<This message was edited>
Cause its foldable


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: And you can store it easily
And I had no arguments
It was objectively better

She was reminding me to be grateful for the things I have (I often forget this), and she said I’m lucky to have a good looking boyfriend
And apparently, my cousin’s girlfriend is not
Both my mom and my aunt does not approve of her lol, and I think for reasonable concerns
I’m looking through my pictures with you, and gosh, you are a beautiful man ‎<This message was edited>
Especially the video of you doing a handstand? 🫣🫣🫣
Hehe forgetting to enroll is you in a parallel universe where we never met
Ooo where can I get this device that turns off your phone? Asking for a friend
These are interesting, I gotta think about my answers
We are going to the Maldives https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-w06MUIJg2/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Bruno Dumont: Lol thanks
She doesn’t know the half of it
Prettiness is not my biggest quality
My biggest qualities as a partner the prob doesn’t know
Cause its just for u
Just cause she is ugly?
Send a pic of her so I can judge
Lol
Yup
Its impossible I already created a technology that block this device
Let’s talk about it in call
Okay
But I know some all inclusive resorts in Brazil too
And the food here is fire
I couldn’t understand the last one I thought it was ni how ken
But he said something else I can’t comprehend
The first two I got it
Wo xi juan ni
Wo hen ai ni


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t have a pic, but it’s because she was impolite to my mom and my aunt, and my cousin spends a lot of money on her ‎<This message was edited>
Yep hao kan is the word for good looking (literally), and mei li is the world for pretty
the third one is a bit complicated
Haha I wouldn’t actually go just for food
‎audio omitted
Bruno Dumont: babe

Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll how do I get him to use his ult on me ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Lol
He is fire
His Q is a bonk
His E pulls people towards him
And his W is a giant ass shield
So he is very straightforward
But has a fun role


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow he’s got everything
Bruno Dumont: And it’s impactful
Can I make a selfish request?

Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m being annoying with gift giving
Bruno Dumont: A bit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Don’t be annoyed with me plz
Bruno Dumont: Don’t stress too much
It’s cute
How much you care
But it’s not a big deal


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know
Bruno Dumont: No one expects you to come bringing hundreds of gifts


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll

Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes 🫣
Bruno Dumont: I have a chance with you?

Pretty Girl 🐦: I think we should touch shoulders
Bruno Dumont: that reminds of the Brasilian girl
that asked if you liked me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: we can't cause it means much more to me than it means to you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg you are never gonna let this go huh
Bruno Dumont: nop

Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahahha

with nothing to do
I instinticvely open whatsapp

Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww bunbun, every time my phone buzzes, I hope it’s a text from you
You have a permanent room in my brain
Bruno Dumont: lol

I really am
I just want to keep telling you
how special and important you are to me
its crazy how we really aged like fine wine


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha me too bunbun. But I’m afraid it’ll get boring for you
Bruno Dumont: I remember I was having some doubts about us


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh yeah?
Bruno Dumont: the day I told you I though we were fighting too much


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
I remember
Bruno Dumont: or some times I felt like I was spending too much time with you and that made me scared I was getting dependent on you
the day you almost broke up with me
that entire week I felt something was off
but now I am very confident in our relationship


Pretty Girl 🐦: Gosh, that week was something
Bruno Dumont: all cause of you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I remember we got mad at each other in the basement of donner
And you left while still upset, and I chased after you
Bruno Dumont: I remember all of this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz I was afraid you would end it
Bruno Dumont: but I don't remembered what happened after
how it ended
I wouldn't


Pretty Girl 🐦: I remember I apologized, and you aknowlegded it
We really need to try the physical touch technique
The next time we have a emotional conflict
Bruno Dumont: Remember the girl at Stanford married to billionair
?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Bruno Dumont: I saw on her Instagram she saying that she does this with her partner
they fight while hugging or cuddling


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww
Well…
Bruno Dumont: she is actually famous
like she appears to me in the reels
and I don't even follow her


Pretty Girl 🐦: I haven’t seen any from her
Bruno Dumont: cause its in portuguese


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why am I so hungry
I wanna eat with bunbun
Why is she famous
Bruno Dumont: She prob got a head start
From being married to a billionaire
And she posts videos about the sillicon valley
Life as rich
Business
Its good stuff


Pretty Girl 🐦: sounds interesting
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
I learned how to stomp
identify I have an advantage
and not let my opponent play
my opponent didn't had a single item
while I had 2 entire itens


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg that’s so fire
Sounds cool
Bruno Dumont: it is cool
but now I'm playing it much better
I'm losing half the farm
and I know how to make good trades
I'm just bad at avoiding ganks


Pretty Girl 🐦: Tanks?
What are ganks
Bruno Dumont: is when you are fighting one guy
and someone else appears
to help


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah
Bruno Dumont: so avoinding ganks


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will help you
Bruno Dumont: is when being aware of the map
so people don't sneak on me
and kill me
the good thing about this character
is that if this happens
I can ult the weakest guy
and it becames a one on one
and I can trade my life for one ohter


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mm good strategy
Bruno Dumont: Darius
is the one guy I haven't fighted yet
and he is much stronger than me
in the beginning
250k maestry
he played over 100 games
like 200 prob

Got reminded of this show cuz I just watched a commentary on squid games season 2, and he said he liked Alice in borderland better ‎<This message was edited>
Bunbun the moon is soooo big tonight
Apparently it’s some blue moon event
Bruno Dumont: I’m a little short on the A+ but a very solid A for sure
Well…
We can give it another try
Fun fact: the rotation of the moon around the earth and the rotation of the moon around itself are synchronized and this is of course no coincidence. This happens because of the tides. The same process that causes tides cause this and the process is the difference in gravitational force the two ends of the earth and moon feel (since one end if further apart) this makes the rotation around itself of both to slow down till its synchronized but since the earth is so much bigger this process is much slower on earth hence why we are not synchronized but the moon is
Fun fact 2: the moon was created when a planet with half size of the earth called thea (might have some misspelling errors here) collided with the earth got destroyed and the debrees from the explosion orbited earth and got together to create the moon

Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh that’s why I always see the same “side” of the moon
Bruno Dumont: Yup

Babe
Remember when we were talking about giving each other grades
And you gave me A- (I can’t believe you did that lol)
Can I ask for a regrade?
Best ones:


Pretty Girl 🐦: Of course, but do be aware that your grade can go down after a regrade
Bruno Dumont: I’m positive on my regrade


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, your new grade is A+
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Now you understand how I felt lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: My only complaint is that the student should stop doing classes online
Bruno Dumont: I remembered we discussed about it
And you were like how can I give you A you are not perfect
And you were impressed I gave you an A lol
Now look who’s the hypocrisy queen again


Pretty Girl 🐦: I still am surprised you gave me an A
I felt I could’ve been so much better in the past
Like big room for improvement
Gonna listen to your playlist now
Bruno Dumont: But that’s not how it is


Pretty Girl 🐦: Also I just ate an empanada, it was very good
Bruno Dumont: I felt satisfied in my relationship
That’s all that matters

I love these night herons. There are so many of them near my house in sh
Bruno Dumont: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaWL1zKzLfg
I think you are the person I can be the most honest with
it is indeed funny
it would have been more funny if I understood the original meaning of immature
then it would break my expectations but nonetheless the delivery was quite good
btw claire its literally the devil
Can u understand this?


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I hope I make you feel safer to share things with me everyday
Yeah you right…I almost went into a spiel about the maturity categories, but I stopped myself ‎<This message was edited>
Why do you say that? She is giving me the vibes of an admission officer lol. ‎<This message was edited>
A bit…but not rigorously

Bruno Dumont: Boa noite pessoal, queria pedir desculpas por hoje (para todos os envolvidos). Queria falar um pouquinho do pq eu sempre gero climão. Eu tenho um transtorno de personalidade grave, então meu humor muda bem rápido. Pessoas comuns tem uma coisa chamada "estabilidade de humor". Enquanto vocês riem, vocês riem. Meu humor já é diferente, mesmo que eu ria de algo, pode virar uma "chavinha" na minha cabeça e eu fico chateada ou com raiva de coisas que os outros acham bobagem, o limiar pra esses sentimentos ruins é bem menor. Eu faço tratamento já tem um tempo, 12 anos, e eu sei absolutamente tudo sobre o meu problema, mas eu percebi algo hoje: eu posso controlar vários aspectos sobre essa doença, mas não posso mudar o que me afeta ou não, vão sempre existir situações diferentes em que eu não vou estar preparada. E eu não acho, de forma alguma, que vocês tenham culpa disso, e nem mesmo devem mudar o jeito por minha causa, eu só sou alguém que "veio com um defeito" pra vida, e faz parte, ninguém tem culpa (exceto aqueles que causaram esse transtorno, durante minha criação). Então desculpa, odeio fazer pessoas lidarem comigo, é um saco ser um saco pros outros. E foi mal pelo textão também, fiquem bem ♥️

Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww
Bruno Dumont: https://youtube.com/shorts/nDh_BlnLCGc?si=abPaFimD8G9YugGQ
look at this
you told me you open you legs for more glute focus
but what matter is Y axis not the X axis


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t open my legs, I just point my toes out
Which also opens my legs but
Oh yeah I do this for squats
For leg press, I just do whats comfortable
Cuz that machine kills me, right after me already dying from the squats
Also, I ran into Armando a few days ago
I was on the hip thrust machine
And he said “oh I can do a bit more weight than that. I feel better about myself now”
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: lol
he just flexed at a girl
half his weight
and 20 years younger


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
Well, quem faz desculpa não faz nada
Bruno Dumont: bruh
you got ir wrong


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: quem eh bom em desculpa
nao eh bom em mais nada


Pretty Girl 🐦: you just made me cry
calling me wrong
Bruno Dumont: Really?
I’m sorry babe


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
Bruno Dumont: You are awesome
Really?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s the type of crying that only your ass can aliviate
Very serious
Bruno Dumont: Omg
I’ll make it up for it then
The only possible way
Wiping your endless tears
Cause you’re never getting my ass


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😭
One day bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Never
Only if u win it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Let a girl dream
Bruno Dumont: But you are incompetent
I let a lot of girls dream about me


Pretty Girl 🐦: NAOoo
Bunbun, do you think it’s strange to ask someone what cologne they are wearing
Bruno Dumont: It depends
If it is a man yes cause I’m the only one you can smell


Pretty Girl 🐦: I asked my PI that today, and he thought I was judging his cologne choice
Bruno Dumont: PI?
That explains the irrational behavior


Pretty Girl 🐦: The prof.
loll
Well
He is wearing a $200 cologne, that in my opinion, doesn’t smell amazing ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: But why were u
Smelling him
😡😡😡
That was your “morning meeting”


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wasn’t. I just happened to smell it. And my brain was like “Santal 33👀?”
lol, my meeting was with my college counselor company
I met their CEO of sorts?
Ready for bunbunnnn! ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I’m free
But not ready
I just lost a game lol
I need to unwind a bit
So I don’t get upset with u
Lemme eat a little bit
Gimme 10


Pretty Girl 🐦: Take your time
Bruno Dumont: The channel I told you
https://youtube.com/shorts/mCbsx4ocLBU?si=7ri40Kzlan7qkSbO


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun?
Bruno Dumont: Sorry
Was eating
‎Video call, ‎37 min


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun I’m sorry I was complaining a lot during our call today. I wish I had communicated my feelings in a more reasonable way, instead of an emotional way
Bruno Dumont: It’s okay babe
I also got unreasonably upset about jt
It might be due to me being already mad before


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hopefully we will both feel better tmr
Bruno Dumont: But
Whenever we have an inconvenience like this
We can always figure it out
In a nice way
You coming now and apologizing for it
Makes me very happy and safe about us
I’m not scared to be trapped with someone who will not treat me well
Or stuck in a relationship I don’t like
Btw it took me 30 mins to write inconvenience cause I made 100 typos one I made 5 times cause my monkey finger touched on v instead of c


Pretty Girl 🐦: I almost didn’t, but I started thinking, what if I actually did something wrong to bunbun, and I realized I did ‎<This message was edited>
I’m glad you feel this way about us
Sounds like someone needs to work on his finger skills
Bruno Dumont: I can finger you just fine


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes you can 🫣
Bruno Dumont: I actually agree with this
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-84nZusuuv/?igsh=MWd4eXNhbXN6NzZzeg==


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, it just seems like an incompatible lifestyle to me.
Morning bunbun
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: yeah
cause look from the other perspective
you are struggling finatially
trying to manage the money for your family


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, ya don’t have to be struggling to want to save money
Bruno Dumont: and your partner consider those things as a necessity
and get annoyed when you try to come up with solutions for managing the situation
I think if you are not struggling its okay for your partner to spend a lot of money on beauty if thats what she likes ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: What?
Bruno Dumont: sorry
forgot a very important word in that sentence
btw call?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I’m ready
Bruno Dumont: expect for you


Pretty Girl 🐦: naoo
Bruno Dumont: you can only spend money on me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo
I like that
Bruno Dumont: buying me gifts
going out with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yessirrr
Bruno Dumont: traveling to my country
stuff like that
I actually dreamt about you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh yeah?
Bruno Dumont: but lemme call you and tell you this over call

Bruno Dumont: baby
you know I really love you right?
it is always a pleasure talking with you
I look forward to it every day


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im just afraid
I don’t know why, but I’m afraid when you tell me things feel off for a while or when you don’t seem to be happy talking to me
and it just makes me very anxious because I don’t know what to do
Maybe we have just been away from each other for too long
And call very frequently
That we aren’t as excited to see each other
But it’s scary
Bruno Dumont: I understand babe
how you feel
I told you once I feel the same
I am also scared of losing you
there is a song I like that says
"If you love someone and you're not afraid to lose them you probably never loved someone like I do"
but we can't let this get in the way of our relationships
I can't get defensive every time you bring up an issue
just because I'm scared you'll stop loving me if you complain about anything
and you can't let this fear get in the way of us having a normal conversation
it was bound to be a routine
when we call each other everyday on the same time its impossible to get excited about it
but it doesn't mean I don't like it
I still enjoy talking with you
I still love you a lot
I have no plans to stop doing so
and I understand how you feel
but it won't happen
you always put effort into making this work
as long as you keep doing it
we'll be fine


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun for reassuring me
Bruno Dumont: of corse ‎<This message was edited>
I love you
I'm here for you
when you need me
in two weeks
you'll se how much I missed you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you too Bruno
Bruno Dumont: I might even cry when I see you
Hold on


Pretty Girl 🐦: I really want to see you
Bruno Dumont: Bruno?
not bunbun>
whats going on here?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: you really stopped loving me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just wanted to make it clear I love you
Bruno Dumont: it is very clear
but go put on that hot swim suit
and go swim a bit
you deserve to have fun
unwind
and have some cool stories to tell me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yessir bunbun
Bruno Dumont: How was ur swimming?


Pretty Girl 🐦: It was so much fun
I kinda taught Anu how to do freestyle and breaststroke
Bruno Dumont: Feeling better now?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
Happy  and hungry
very hungry
Bruno Dumont: Well

Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg

Humiliating loss

Bruno Dumont: Babe

Pretty Girl 🐦: Alright, thanks for telling me bunbun
We prob won’t call till tmr then
Bruno Dumont: Okay
Fine
If you don’t love me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha sorry bunbun. I have the thing at 5, and I’m gonna be in the makerspace till then
Bruno Dumont: What thing?
The expensive dinner?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol yeah
Im excited to see this counselor again
He is a little crazy
Very fun to be around
Bruno Dumont: Good thing you liked him
Let’s do this?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hell yeah
Bruno Dumont: But you can’t leave my sorry ass
Till ur 100


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was reading an article about the Tsimanes people, whose hearts “age slower”
And they have 70-80 year old people doing 3 day long hunts
Bruno Dumont: What’s their secret?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t wanna leave bunbun’s ass
But also, you can leave me
No matter how annoying I get
Bruno Dumont: You can’t leave somewhere you never been


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: And my ass was never yours


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s mine 😋
Bruno Dumont: Feeling better now?
I can give you more reassurance
If you want
I don’t mind since it’s all true


Pretty Girl 🐦: I am feeling better
But I would like reassurance
Bruno Dumont: ‎Video call, ‎2 min


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think I just really miss you
And the pressure is getting a bit much
If I’m not working, I just feel sad
Is it similar to how you were feeling sometimes? Like when you feel like nothing you do makes the bad feeling go away
Bruno Dumont: Yeah in some ways
But I don’t think its just me babe
You are lonely
It’s exactly the same thing


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: Lol
U are babe
But when I called you
I was trying to help
‎audio omitted
Lol
how are u rn?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun, I really appreciate your efforts ‎<This message was edited>
Im doing well, spent an hour figuring out the 3d printer lol
‎video omitted
So freaking cool
Yeah I understand bunbun
Bruno Dumont: why are u printing a tiny vase?


Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0
…uh no🤫
You will never guess
What I’m using it for
Bruno Dumont: is it for my family's present
like the flowers


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nope
Bruno Dumont: a vase for them
see
you are always thinking of me
doing things for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hopefully you get to see what it will be used for
Bruno Dumont: why would I get tired of u


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Because
Idk, it’s just a big fear of mine that you will be bored of me
Bruno Dumont: but I won't
u make me happy
and I'm not stupid
I know that relationships in the beginning are more exciting
you don't know your partner so there is a lot of mistery
but I value the benefits of a long term relationship
trust


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im glad you recognize that
Bruno Dumont: intimacy
emotional connection
some things need time
and I have an idea of what I want my life to be
and in it there is a family
so it only make sense to keep a relationship
as long as it is a good one
and our is awesome
if we stay together we can accomplish for I want for my life


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s very reassuring to hear
Thank you bunbun
You communicate your feeling very well
Bruno Dumont: Its cause I operate on a rational and logical mindset


Pretty Girl 🐦: And that makes me feel confident in your feelings
Bruno Dumont: so it is easy to explain
if I gambled my house on the cassino
there is no way I can explain that
it came from an irrational point any way
Wish u were here
To listen to his bangers with me

Bruno Dumont: Is the songs


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, have a good sleep and dream of me
Bruno Dumont: Noooo
I have to stop
Dreaming bout u
Cause I get depressed
I’ll quote que big crier here
“Hoje estou feliz porque sonhei com você mas amanhã posso chorar por não poder te ver”


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww
Who said this
Bruno Dumont: “O seu sorriso vale mais que um diamante se você esta comigo então nos vamo a diante”
“Com a cabeça erguida e mantando a fe em deus o seu dia mais feliz vai ser o mesmo que o meu”
“E a vida me ensinou a nunca desistir nem ganhar nem perder mas procurar evoluir”


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok it’s getting a little complex
Bruno Dumont: “Podem me tirar tudo que tenho só não podem me tirar as coisas boas que eu ja fiz pra quem eu amo eu sou feliz e canto o universo eh uma canção e eu vou que vou”
“Histórias nossas histórias dias de luta dias de glória”
Its all a song
From the big crier (chorão)
Charlie Brown Jr


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ohhh
It’s from that song
I never caught the rap part
Bruno Dumont: I think I can sing it all
If you tell me the first sentence


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cute
It’s too close to my bed time 🥱
I feel drunk on sleepiness
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-m7NAIu6x_/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
I love you bunbun
Guess. I wanna guess yours too https://www.instagram.com/reel/C--poR5K0kd/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Bruno Dumont: Babe
You were drunk of sleepyness
At 1 am for me
And when to bed
Two and a half hours later?
Why?
I’ll guess 8
I’ll guess 8
Since from the normal options I can’t really tell
I’ll try to bet on your quirkyness
What is your guess?
Babe
Let’s take a class together

Pretty Girl 🐦: Good morningggg

Bruno Dumont: Understandable have a great day

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bro how did you get it right???
Yes
Bruno Dumont: I know u baby
U are kinda autistic
Of course it wouldn’t be a normal girl thing
How about me?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know you were into Pokémon, so I would guess 10.
But I feel like
That’s the trick option
Bruno Dumont: Final answer?
Me want to go to Europe


Pretty Girl 🐦: …’me scared

Bruno Dumont: ?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck should I change it

Bruno Dumont: Got it
It was 10
All the others were either gay
Or stupid


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
No
No European girls for you
Bruno Dumont: please

Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll give you a compromise
European men, or Chinese girl (singular). You can pick
Bruno Dumont: What?
Babe it’s just looking
I don’t even think of it as something sexual


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooo
Bruno Dumont: You know I don’t think of tities like that
I’m a mature grown men


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: This trivialities don’t matter to me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh yeah?
If it ain’t sexual, don’t open this picture
Bruno Dumont: Ok


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
It doesn’t look that good, sorry bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Sorry I accidentally clicked it
Mb
But it’s definitely not sexual
I wouldn’t even open
My finger just slipped


Pretty Girl 🐦: 🙄
Bruno Dumont: It looked awesome babe


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun
I also don’t think of asses as a sexual thing
Bruno Dumont: too bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun

Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok we can try
‎This message was deleted.
Bruno Dumont: I’m happy you liked the idea of cs 7
I think its good for us to learn about money as a couple


Pretty Girl 🐦: It sounded interesting
I agree
Bruno Dumont: I know a bit about how things work in Brasil
But I don’t know shit about the us
I still don’t know what a 401k is


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I only have vague understandings
But now, I wanna learn about your ass
Bruno Dumont: No ass
For you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun
Fine, deals off
Bruno Dumont: Babe

Bruno Dumont: But get me mine back
‎image omitted

It took me less then one minute to reply


Pretty Girl 🐦: I have to get in the mood again
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry babe
I was with my mom when u asked for it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah you should’ve told me so
Bruno Dumont: I was teasing u


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok
I think you took it kinda far
Bruno Dumont: Just cause I didn’t send u my ass?
Within 5 minutes of u asking for it?


Pretty Girl 🐦: You were making promises/deals, but then breaking them ‎<This message was edited>
Or saying you are breaking them
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry you felt that way


Pretty Girl 🐦: And that was very frustrating for me
Bruno Dumont: I was going to send u
But you being upset with me about it
Seems a little excessive


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s not about the picture bunbun
It’s about you breaking promises
Bruno Dumont: But I didn’t break them


Pretty Girl 🐦: You did so here
Made up this condition ‎<This message was edited>
Felt like you were playing me for a fool
This is a ridiculous situation. I’m moving on. The emotionlessness of texts put us on different pages regarding the other’s feelings ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry but look from my perspective
try reading it again from my point of view
I was just teasing you while waiting for my mom to order food for us
so I can go take your pic


Pretty Girl 🐦: But how would I know that
Bruno Dumont: and now you are upset with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: If you didn’t let me know
Bruno Dumont: like it feels like everything I say makes you sad


Pretty Girl 🐦: You should also consider my perspective
Bruno Dumont: how would I know you would care this much
when you texted me you were serious about this
I took it for you in less than a minute
but it seemed something so insignificant


Pretty Girl 🐦: It is insignificant bunbun. Because I’m not annoyed because of the picture
But because from my perspective, you were just making me do things, and then not keeping your word
Bruno Dumont: but its something irrelevant
and I apologized for it
but I think you are overreacting


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I said it’s fine
Bruno Dumont: and I told you this a few days ago
that it seems like everything I do is a problem


Pretty Girl 🐦: I also feel that way
‎This message was deleted.
Let’s give this problem some time, and come back to it
I love you bunbun. I don’t wanna make you feel bad, and I want to find a solution for both of us
Bruno Dumont: I also love you
and we can talk about this later
but I still haven't said everything I want to say
so we need to talk about it still
whenever you feel better
babe
we need to talk
I'm sad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, open your mind to me bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Can I call u soon?
20 minutes
Lemme just calm first


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
I’ll eat a protein bar
Bruno Dumont: I just got really anxious
I'm shaking rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m sorry bunbun, what are you anxious about
Bruno Dumont: about our fight
but I don't know if we should talk now


Pretty Girl 🐦: I planned to talk later, but if you feel like that will worsen your feeling of anxiety, we can try now
Bruno Dumont: lemme tell you what I was thinking
I just think the things I did that annoyed you were things you gave me permition to do in a certain way. Like teasing you with things that are sexual or making a joke about the "silent treatment" and I stopped when you explicitly told me to do so when you said that you were serious about the photo or when you told me that really made you sad. I just thing that something happened with you and the arrays of things I can do you find funny and teasy got smaller but you just expect me to understand that without you telling me
but after I calmed down I understand that it is important for me to understand what makes you sad
I just wish you would tell me first and then get upset
but when you communicate with me its already too late


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎audio omitted
‎audio omitted
Bruno Dumont: but then its impossible for me
cause you told me you like when I joke about what makes you sad
and take it in a lighter way
expect when I cant and it makes it worse
and I can only know after you get upset
like when you texted me that you were getting annoyed


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎audio omitted
Bruno Dumont: it didn't take me a minute to send you the picture


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎audio omitted
Bruno Dumont: its because it happened every day this week
first it was the silent treatment
then it was something else I can't remember
then it was when I told you about your muscles
now it was this
it seems like every time I call you something I do upsets you
and it makes me feel like a terrible partner
cause I know you are sad
and I try to cheer you up
and everything I do just makes it worse
like when I was playing league you told me you were feeling lonely
and I though I could just call you and we could do our stuff while keeping each other company
and you just seemed more annoyed at me
I don't want you to not like me
or get upset with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎audio omitted
And I’m sorry I made you feel like I didn’t like being with you
Bruno Dumont: its just
you talked as if it was just my fault
like I was mistreating you
but I felt a little blindsighted in some way
cause I always try very hard to understand the boundaries with you
and they seem to suddently change
and its now all my fault


Pretty Girl 🐦: But that’s not what I was trying to do when explaining why i was upset
I was trying to explain, why I was upset. I didn’t mean to blame everything on you
Bruno Dumont: I know
I'm feeling much better now


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad you are bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I don’t know why
I was shaking
My heart was pounding
babe
so glad we were able to talk again


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too bunbun
‎image omitted
Omg the jinga game between Quackity and Enaldinho. Chef kiss
Bruno Dumont: The story of enaldinho is fire
About how he went to the video


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: alright
take care of it
please


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is it too early to joke bout this https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-3KwtZIiZo/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Have a good sleep bunbun
I really liked when you reassured me after our fights.
I would appreciate you very much, if I could wake up to some of those messages
Bruno Dumont: Okie dokie


Pretty Girl 🐦: I cried reading about a character gettinf comforted by another lol
You know, I would like some now, to be honest
Bruno Dumont: Babe
I love you
so very much
everytime we fight
somehow
I end up loving you more
and more
cause it makes me safe
to know I have a mature partner
for life


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun
But I don’t feel better after our fight today
That is my own problem to solve. You have done a lot for me already
Bruno Dumont: why not?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m feeling very negatively. But I also don’t want to talk to you about it, because as you have said, every time we’ve called I’ve been upset at you. But this makes me feel worse, as I feel bad for feeling wronged
But I don’t know what to do. This is the worst I’ve ever felt this summer
I don’t really care that I’m feeling bad. But I don’t want you to dislike me, because I’m being this way
Bruno Dumont: I don't dislike you
and won't
I promise


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m just gonna try to let this go.
Bruno Dumont: I’m sorry ur feeling like this
I want to be a safe place for you
To be able to feel safe with me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I know you are trying
Bruno Dumont: I think its just a hard time
which is bound to make things complicated
but it will all be over soon
very soon


Pretty Girl 🐦: I really hope what ever this is passes
it’s making me feel a bit detached
Bruno Dumont: in what way?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like I just want to avoid
and not feel
Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry babe
do you want me to call you for a bit
to keep you company


Pretty Girl 🐦: No
Bruno Dumont: I'm prob going to bed soon
its almost midnight here


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah you should. It’s pretty late
I’m sorry to be a downer for your night
Bruno Dumont: you are not a downer for my night
You are not a problem
You are going through a problem
And your problem is the problem
Not you
I’m on your team


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s a nice way to think about it
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
We arw always on the same team
Against problems
And it doesn’t matter
If they come from me
Or from you
Or from both
We are a team


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun, for your support
Bruno Dumont: I think I was a little insensitive
I think that’s a portuguese mistranslation
But I needed to handle this with more caution
Because I didn’t realize the extent of your “sadness”
I saw a thing that said that marriages are not 50:50
Some times someone can’t bring the whole 50
And the other has to make up for it
So rn you don’t need to worry too much about me
If you need to tell me anything just do so
I’ll cover you up
In some way

That, no. Call me, yes.

Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
Bruno Dumont: To my house
So I can call u after your trip
Babe
Can you give me some reassurance too


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m in the mood of not wanting to move 🥺
This is so bad
I really hope my mental health gets better soon. It is bothering my daily functionings
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I think I’m the same
I just had a talk with my mom
And she was asking me if I wanted to see a physiologist
Cause she thinks I’m disliking my lifr
And it’s affecting our relationship
And I think it’s true
I stopped going to the gym
Waking up early
Eating correctly
Even hanging out with friends
I’m just waiting for like to pass away
I’m crying rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, I love you not because of you healthy habits, but because you are the most caring man I have met.
Bruno Dumont: I’m not implying this
I’m just saying that I’m slowly losing control of my life


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s my reassurance. But lemme know what specific kind of reassurance you want
Bruno Dumont: And regressing on the things that matter
I just want some company
Rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why do you think you are losing control?
I think I can relate to how you are feeling
I’m here for you
Bruno Dumont: I think I’m getting depressed


Pretty Girl 🐦: We can call or just text
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Honestly me too
It’s hard, but it’s not a permanent feeling
My mom always told me that usually, we become unhappy if we don’t get something we want
But we forgot that we have so many good things already
Aww bunbun, i want to give you a very big hug
Bruno Dumont: I think the problems we are having rn
It’s cause neither of us has strength rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: I agree
Bruno Dumont: To really help each other
And we can’t even be sad together


Pretty Girl 🐦: But we are a power couple, we will figure this out together
Even if we can only be on power saving mode rn
The feeling really is temporary
I thought the world was ending around me last night
Then I got out of bed, ate an apple, and boom, my emotions settled down
Bruno Dumont: I don’t have apples on me
I’m fucked


Pretty Girl 🐦: Shit, I heard bananas work too
But only if you ingest it with your ass
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: Didn’t laugh


Pretty Girl 🐦: When do you ever laugh at my jokes huh
Bruno Dumont: Do you even make them?


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I always laugh enough for both of us at my jokes
Bruno Dumont: Thanks babe


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck off, if you are such a comedy master, then why are you depressed
Bruno Dumont: I’m feeling better


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe I’m glad
Bruno Dumont: But I’ll give you some feedback
When I need reassurance


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
Bruno Dumont: I think its usually more about me feeling bad about myself
Not about us
I just need you to tell me I’m doing great


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
Bruno Dumont: And point out good things about me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, bunbun, you really are doing great. I’m really proud of you for holding on for so long. I know all the moving around and your friends being busy has been hard on you
And me, being a big baby
Bruno Dumont: Stop


Pretty Girl 🐦: And yet, you make me and your friend so happy, and you are always fun to be around ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: No talking bad about you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha ok
Being a baby is not a bad thing
Sometimes we gotta let our adult side rest and recover ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t know you had one


Pretty Girl 🐦: What happened to following this rule 🙄
Bruno Dumont: Only I can talk smack about my girl
Just like only brasilians can complain about Brasil


Pretty Girl 🐦: My cute little hypocrite
Bruno Dumont: Learning from u


Pretty Girl 🐦: When will I be able to do so
I have a lot to say
Bruno Dumont: Never
Only after we marry
And u get citizenship
And its only mild complaints


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha fine
I’ll just hold me tongue for now
Bruno Dumont: You’ll never have full access to all the complaints


Pretty Girl 🐦: You can be my speaker of the house
We need one. You like cherry tomatoes, and I like cool lamps. Win win https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-22FJLg1sd/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Bruno Dumont: Babe

Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg, im watching the video and I wanna rip my hair out
Bruno Dumont: Lol

Pretty Girl 🐦: I hate the boyfriend the girl
Bruno Dumont: I’ll send u the others
The girlfriend is the only one that deserves no hate


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
Bruno Dumont: Watch till the end
The last thing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg, you will have to physical restrain me if I catch a girl talking to you like that in front of me
Bruno Dumont: Lol
It wouldn’t ever happen


Pretty Girl 🐦: Claire is pretty tho ‎<This message was edited>

Pretty Girl 🐦: I just saw it on Reddit
Bruno Dumont: because of the weather


Pretty Girl 🐦: I agree
Bruno Dumont: and I didn't want to use all chill classes at once


Pretty Girl 🐦: That would be enjoyable tho
Bruno Dumont: babe


Pretty Girl 🐦: I miss you so much that I just wanna watch you for a bit
Bruno Dumont: I just had the most fun
league game
of my life


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyy
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Tell me about it
Bruno Dumont: since my account was banned I'm playing on a new one
and I completly stomped those noobs


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
Bruno Dumont: its funny how I would go for a tower
they would send no joke 3 people to kill me
I would ult one and kill them
get low


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
Bruno Dumont: they would come thinking they can win
I use my shield and bonk them to death


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s so evil
Bruno Dumont: I was full build 5 items and boots the enemy had two items no boots
from the 30 kills from my team 22 were mine
the other 8 were the 4x2 they were playing after I killed 3 people


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: this character is very good for this situation
cause I have enough damage to kill everyone fast
but I'm tanky as fuck when I'm fed
so there is no counterplay
and if you send the entire team


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too
Bruno Dumont: I can kill one in my ult 1x1 and the rest of my team can do whatever they want since its now a 4x4 with 4 people on one lane
cute
sorry for the nerdying here


Pretty Girl 🐦: Nah I wanted to know

This cat just appeared in the farm
and we adopted him for a week
while we were there


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwwww
Bruno Dumont: he was very small
and I was scared of every animal
but he was so small


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: I wasn't scared of him

Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s so sweet
Bruno Dumont: I would play with him
and he was so cute lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Man, kittens
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: we can have one
if its a plushy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im glad im not that into animals lol
Bruno Dumont: I would be open for a discussion of having a cat
but I'm unable to take care of it
and it needs to be a very docile one
and I would probably need a lot of time to get used to it
but a dog is a big no no for me


Pretty Girl 🐦: My problem is the smell
Bruno Dumont: sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: Animals smell bad
Bruno Dumont: I'll take a shower


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: my bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah bunbun, I can smell it from here
It’s not like I like your smell of anything
I definitely don’t smell your jacket sometimes

Pretty Girl 🐦: Naooo
Bruno Dumont: but applied the gap


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyyy
Bruno Dumont: I was baiting them so hard
cause I could kill them but I couldt get to them
so I went back and forth till they made one misstep and demolished them


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: but it got me so mad
when I was winning so bad
and thought I would lose

Bruno Dumont: I’m used to it
So
You’ll be coming here on 9
And my dad wanted to go to pirinopolis on 10 and 11
Going there involves a fair share of walking
And it might be tiring
My grandma told me u might get tired
Since its right after u arive
Do you think u can do it
Or do you want to push it back
I’m fine either way


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
The 10th is the next morning when I wake up.
Bruno Dumont: Yup
So you would have the 9 from 2 pm till might
Sleep and next day in the morning go
Its a 3 hour drive too
But you can go next to me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel it might be better to push it back a little?
Bruno Dumont: But no holding hands cause that’s too personal


Pretty Girl 🐦: but I am also fine just going on the 10th if that’s the best time for your dad
Bruno Dumont: We’re not there yet


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im cancelling my ticket rn

Made me very happy haha
Bruno Dumont: She single?


Pretty Girl 🐦: he’s a man
Bruno Dumont: Bro

I felt sexually assaulted by his comment


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha he’s like 1/2 men that I actually talked with in my entire highschool
He is straight, mostly I think. He dated the Ukrainian girl I’m friends with

Pretty Girl 🐦: But I also switched a retainer so
Bruno Dumont: I looked through every PHYSWELL and WELLNESS class in the navigate courses
To see what’s interesting


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why is there a brasilian version of the Eurovision 2023 winner song?? https://open.spotify.com/track/5LCegtYPODbcqbTE5CZVv8?si=bfjYnOgrTVCjof-igdECEA
It’s so different from the original https://open.spotify.com/track/1DmW5Ep6ywYwxc2HMT5BG6?si=c98z_oRyQDacZBK3rlWeuA
Bruno Dumont: this one is in the playlist I sent u
its kinda famous in Brasil
the lyrics is very different though
The brasilian one talks about this couple and how everyone doubted them but they stuck together and will stay like that forever
kinda gay tbh


Pretty Girl 🐦: I just had such an entertaining lunch with my coworkers
It was a dynamic I have never experienced before
And maybe I’ll only experience it here
Bruno Dumont: Explain

Gosh I forgot to mention one thing
That came up in my chat with my high school friend
And now I remembered cuz I was flipping through stories
He used to never post stories. But recently, he would post 3-4 everyday. And he told me, before, he would be sharing all these reels with his girl, but now he can’t. So he shares it with everyone instead ‎<This message was edited>
😭😭😭
Bruno Dumont: lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s so sad
Bruno Dumont: it is
cause it would be me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like imagine, I see this cute bunny video
Bruno Dumont: I would have so many reels


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I can’t share it with bunbun
Bruno Dumont: and I would open WhatsApp to send someone
and would just close it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn, I need a bunbun hug
Bruno Dumont: I will give you all


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, I will be collecting
‎image omitted
I have been emailing this library for almost a month, asking for help locating a document, cuz their collection is so big ‎<This message was edited>
I couldn’t manually find it. And I gave up cuz I thought they were ghosting me ‎<This message was edited>
But as I have 1 hour left in my work here, they send me the exact papers I needed to complete my research question 😭

Baby
My mom got home


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oof
Bruno Dumont: And she went to check on me and saw I was jn the bathroom
So I had to not talk


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg
Bruno Dumont: But when you asked me what I was doing
I had finished


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m glad you did
Bruno Dumont: But tbh it wasn’t that good
It was so nice


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh..
Bruno Dumont: But my mom
Really ruined the mood


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol, I can imagine
Bruno Dumont: It was the biggest turn off
But babe you are so hit
That was so good


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun
‎This message was deleted.
Bruno Dumont: babe
it was really nice
For real
its crazy how hot you are
I was joking about that singer ass
but if I'm being honest
your ass is the best one
perfect size and shape
I really like it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I know you were. But sometimes my insecurities take it seriously
I am also constantly amazed how hot my bunbun looks
Bruno Dumont: but
Its not about me now
its about you]
you are pretty
and amazing
I really think that
and I know other people feel the same
and it doesn't matter if you are slacking off in the gym
you did something already incredible
you kept it consistent for 9 months
its way past the point of failure


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck, you are so good at comforting me, and making me feel better about myself
Bruno Dumont: it already became a part of you


Pretty Girl 🐦: You know exactly what’s eating at me
Bruno Dumont: now it will come and go as your life changes
all of my friends who are jacked as fuck
have the same thing
periods of big consistency
and periods of slacking off
but as long as its still part of you and I know it is
it doesn't really impact your long term progress


Pretty Girl 🐦: This is really nice to hear. Sometimes I don’t give myself enough credit for the progress I’ve made
Bruno Dumont: thanks to muscle memory stopping for a bit every once in a while is so chill
cause its me (I'm eating your ass)


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
I’ll reserve a table for you
Bruno Dumont: Yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: But thank you bunbun.
Bruno Dumont: cause the hardest part is the beginning
your still confused about the gym
shit hurts as fuck
and you see no progress
and you got over it
now you know what ur doing
you got your results


Pretty Girl 🐦: All thanks to bunbun being my motivation and my personal trainer
It’s really nice to feel how much you care about me
I hope I make you feel the same
Bruno Dumont: yeah
but fuck that excuse
its not cause of me
its cause of you
you went there and did the things
a lot of people have personal trainers and can't do shit


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm true. Maybe they just need a hot ass trainer
Gosh that ass
Bruno Dumont: no
they need the discipline you have
the maturity to see into the future
and do something kinda mid now that will pay out later
people have trouble doing this
I'm lucky my girl has it


Pretty Girl 🐦: You are right. Working out is a very long term plan
Bruno Dumont: not that long term though
I already got results out of it


Pretty Girl 🐦: And I’m glad bunbun recognizes that in me 🫣
True, there are short term benefits
Bruno Dumont: looking good naked
but I guess some people like you
can't understand it
image how nice it would be to already be born hot like you
I had to fight to not look like I'm on drugs


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha, cute bunbun
Well our struggles are on the two different extremes lol
Bruno Dumont: yeah
me extremelly ugly u extremely hot


Pretty Girl 🐦: No talking shit about yourself
You are pretty. And nothign is gonna change that perception
And in my eyes, you aren’t just pretty. You are the prettiest man I have seen
Bruno Dumont: yeah yeah
maybe the only part of your body
that is not awesome
is your eyes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Every time I see you, gosh, life is worth living
Bruno Dumont: I'm not downplaying myself


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s racist
Bruno Dumont: that's a very good one babe
I'm very proud of you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you thank you, I’m very proud to receive approval from Mr comedy master ‎<This message was edited>

‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lollll
Asshole
I’m 15mins into the black hole video
It’s super interesting
Bruno Dumont: who would have thought
the video I cherry picked for my girlfried
and sent her thinking of her
would be of her interest
really unimaginable


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I wonder how they know, to an observer, the object would seem frozen in time
Like it’s just what their math suggests right
Bruno Dumont: they don't 'know' cause its impossible to observe


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: in physics you can only say something for certain when the experiments are made
but what exists is the theorical model


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m kinda confused by the 2d cone diagram they had tho
To explain the space we could ever interact with?
Fucking hell its so cool
Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s so cool because I’m seeing things I learned in math 21 being applied to the explaination of how black holes exist
Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted
lol so glad you liked it what math 21 thing did you see on the video?
I didn't remember any calculus on it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha just small things, like coordinate substituition (we used for vectors) and the idea of limit going to inifinity applied to time
Bruno Dumont: make sense
its cause I've first seen those ideas outside of calculus
so I didn't even thought about this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah,
That’s why it prob seems elementary to you
Bruno Dumont: it doesn't sound elementary
but natural


Pretty Girl 🐦: But to me, math 21 was my first math course where I got some understanding of math beyond algebra ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: if that makes sense


Pretty Girl 🐦: I didn’t understand shit in ap calc
Bruno Dumont: I don't think like oh this is this technique that I learned in X place I just think like yeah that seems like the correct approach
understandable
I still think its crazy people learning calc in hs


Pretty Girl 🐦: You think it should be earlier?
Bruno Dumont: no lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh
Bruno Dumont: in Brasil you only learn it in college


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I though you mean we should introduce such concepts earlier or something
Which I think would be interesting to try
Bruno Dumont: I don't think calculus is the problem
if you learn math well enough
if you have a good enough base
you are fine learning calculus when you need to use it


Pretty Girl 🐦: What is a good “base”
That sounds very abstract
Bruno Dumont: well
being confutable manipulating algebraic expressions
being good at math in general
like the problem solving approach of math
understanding very well all of the pre-calc


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see
That’s a big jump lol
I remember learning about functions
Bruno Dumont: but I'm not the right person to ask this


Pretty Girl 🐦: And all I understood was, oh you just draw a line on a chart
Bruno Dumont: I don't know how normal people learn math


Pretty Girl 🐦: Education is definitely a complicated topic
lol bunbun too smart
Bruno Dumont: come on


Pretty Girl 🐦: You just get it
Bruno Dumont: its just like


Pretty Girl 🐦: You’re like my mom
Bruno Dumont: I don't remember when I learned about functions
it just seems so intuitive to me
you put something in something comes out chill


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn, I’m envious
Oh well
Bruno Dumont: well I'm so glad you liked it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t think my sister inherited rhe intuition from my mom either so
Bruno Dumont: I'll scout the internet for more interesting math/science videos


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok! Thanks bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I'm so sad our kid is going to be dumb


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😭😭
Bruno Dumont: regression to the mean
kids from smart parents
are usually not as smart as their parents


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
Idk if that’s accurate
Bruno Dumont: and kids from dumb parents
are not as dumb as their parents
it is statistically accurate


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, this makes sense
Bruno Dumont: that's in everything


Pretty Girl 🐦: But, statistics can be manipulated
If we play our cards right
Bruno Dumont: data can be manipulated


Pretty Girl 🐦: And we got a good hand
Bruno Dumont: but statistics its just math
my hand is okay
I talked with my dad
he said he is going to book the first the option
from the hotels I showed u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg yayyy

Pretty Girl 🐦: If you fucking change the opening time, have you schedule reflect that
Bruno Dumont: why don't we save this present for our anniversary?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh well
Bruno Dumont: you'll have time to finish it with no rush


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im literally so close to being done
Bruno Dumont: can't you now finish by yourself?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No, I need hot glue and some machine help
Me calm now
Bruno Dumont: so

I'm feeling the big want to do something


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbunn
Bruno Dumont: like that same old thing
but high intensity now
that's kinda why I hanged up at the time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im sorry bunbun, I can relate to how you feel
Bruno Dumont: I know you do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you think it’s still because of the league game?
Bruno Dumont: that's what makes it even better
to tell u
no
playing league was helping
it just wasn't helping today
I think its more because of the absence of the game


Pretty Girl 🐦: I see
I wish I could be good at league
And make it so you always win
And get to the character you want
Bruno Dumont: lol
that's very sweet of you
but its not about the league lol
I just wanted something good to do
and you being here would fullfull that quite well
you don't need to do all of that
just go on a date with me
like the one we had
I think that was the best day of my life so far


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awwwww
Bruno Dumont: maybe second


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would happily go on more dates with bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I still love the day I got into stanford


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
Bruno Dumont: but it was just like the last 2 hours of the day
yours was the entire fucking day
but I can see that in a few years you're gonna have 9 out of the 10 best days
and prob number 1 too

This was my reaction 10 seconds into the video
Bruno Dumont: babe
I know you said you had trouble with deep squats
it has nothing to do with the ugly girl from the beginning


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll, thank you bunbun, I appreciate you sending the video to me
Can I practice this
On top of you
I would be really motivated to train some deep squats
Fuck I accidentally saw your gatinho picture again
And now I want to be with you so badly
Bruno Dumont: lol
me too babe
I ate
now I'm better


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyy
it’s crazy how sometimes food can help regulate our emotions
Bruno Dumont: Yup
But the food I want
Is too far away
On stanford campus


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh yeah, I heard there’s a bakery that sells a really nice cake
Bruno Dumont: Gosh I miss that salmon


Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0

Bruno Dumont: I'm about to change that


Pretty Girl 🐦: I showed you cuz it looked kinda sad
Even my mom was like omg is that what you eat everyday
Looking forward to that 😋
Bruno Dumont: it didn't look sad
it looked fire
love watermelon


Pretty Girl 🐦: The turkey is actually moist as well!
Bruno Dumont: Yo that’s fire
just added more moisturizer
my mom even applied the expensive one she had lol
cicaplaste


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg that makes me so happy to hear
Bruno Dumont: and I sucked 5 dicks
on this past 30 seconds


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
Just like me
Bruno Dumont: babe
those types of joke are not funny


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
What joke?
Bruno Dumont: babe
I'm serious
those types of joke
are not funny


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like actually serious?
Press 1 if you are serious
Bruno Dumont: 2


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe
Bruno Dumont: I wanted to keep pressing you
but that would be too mean


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cute
Bruno Dumont: poodles?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Poodles?
Bruno Dumont: do you not remember
that one reel
I sent you
5 months ago
wow
that really shows your low commitment to this relationship


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg yes I do
They say it when they don’t mean something?
Bruno Dumont: no
you say it when you really mean it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Got it
Like a safe word type
Bruno Dumont: and as a question you use to ask if the person is serious
so if you ask like do I look good rn
and I answer yes
you can ask "poodles?"


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg Im never doing that
Bruno Dumont: and if I reply "poodles"
its because I really thing that
and I'm not saying it just to make you happy
and for what its worth
I do think that for real
you look absolutely amazing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Poodles?
Bruno Dumont: always
poodles


Pretty Girl 🐦: awwwwww
That’s so sweet
I think I truly believe you now ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: wow
finally


Pretty Girl 🐦: When you tell me you think I look good
Bruno Dumont: let's go baby
I do mean it always


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: which is kinda crazy
I never though you look bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
But I understand, because it’s how I feel about you
Bruno Dumont: like I can see that you look better on X picture than on Y picture
or like that small bikini looked way too good on you
but never once I though you looked bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: or even mid
you always look at least stunning


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn, that’s really nice to hear bunbun
I feel the same about you truly
Bruno Dumont: strange
ngl
maybe get your glasses an upgrade?

Bunbun, do you remember the date for 106b finals in the fall?
Bruno Dumont: No
I don’t
Okay
That makes me very relieved
And excited for the future
But I don’t want to rush things
We can enjoy this when the time comes
Now let’s enjoy other parts of life
Our trips
Our dates
Our sex
Our movie nights every night
Cuddles

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun I just woke up
I oversleptt:(
Bruno Dumont: Lol
That’s fine
I was just worried
Cause u saw my message 5 times
But didn’t reply lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Did I?
Bruno Dumont: Yeah


Pretty Girl 🐦: I must of checked my phone I guess
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wanna see bunbunnn
Bruno Dumont: Babe
Can u reply to my messages first
About this


Pretty Girl 🐦: Eu gosto do terceiro e primeiro
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: O terceiro nn eh em pirinopolis
Eh em corumbá
Eh pertinho
A gente tava querendo ir nesse no primeiro dia
Ai dorme naquele hotel
E passa a noite em pirinopolis


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
Bruno Dumont: Ai no outro dia
Ir nas cachoeiras de pirinopolis
Podemos ir em uma e passar o dia ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok
Bruno Dumont: Ou ir em duas no mesmo dia
Uma de tarde e uma de noite


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would be happy going to any of these bunbun
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
But
What would u choose?
What’s the happiest one
I personally want to go to the salto corumbá
But for the second day I have no preferences


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah me too. Ele tem animals
I know you love em
Bruno Dumont: Ele tem tirolesa
Looks cool
You are a little kid
Wanting to ser the animals


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎This message was deleted.
‎sticker omitted
That’s me ^
EU ENTENDIIIIII
omg here is my theory
The woman in the picture is a only fans person, or does something related to porn. And she gave food to kids, very good.
But the second comment is like she took money from the people who buy her content and gave it to the poor, paralleling robinhood
Who stole from the rich to give to the poor
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
But
You need to explain the jome
From the top comment


Pretty Girl 🐦: What joke
Ohh top comment
Lemme see
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: No
The one that says
E o que q ela fez com a comida
Something on those lines


Pretty Girl 🐦: O M G
Deu pra crianças
Omg that’s evil
Bruno Dumont: Yup you got it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, say goodbye to your ass, just like what she did
Bruno Dumont: But there is still one piece ledt
You have to explain
Why did people refer to her
As beiçola do privacy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck
What yeh fuck is beiçola
Bruno Dumont: Beiço is like the lower lips
In ur mouth


Pretty Girl 🐦: The lower lip?
Bruno Dumont: Beiçola is a nickname usually given to people with big beiço


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s so specific
Oh I see
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted
But that is not the reason
She is called beiçola


Pretty Girl 🐦: And privacy is just privacy?
Bruno Dumont: That was just a hint
U need to figure out by urself
To get the ass reward


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg lemme think
And why are words crossed out
Bruno Dumont: Privacy its an only fans like
They cencored it because of social media policy
Just figure out the beiçola part lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo
I don’t knowww, I have a thought but it’s very vulgar
Can I just see bunbunnnn
Bruno Dumont: Lol
There is this character
Called beiçola
From a brasilian tv show
Search him up
He is kinda ugly
And has a very distinct look
And people say she looks like him
Beiçola grande família
You can find if u search this


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol what
She doesn’t
Bruno Dumont: So
You got most of it


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😭😭
Bruno Dumont: I’ll give you
2 minutes


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s the worst
Bruno Dumont: Of access to my ass


Pretty Girl 🐦: 😳

Bruno Dumont: With absolutely no chance at my butthole
You can squeeze it
But nothing that hurts


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg

Pretty Girl 🐦: Sorry I missed your call bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I'm playing with a friend


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok!
Bruno Dumont: having a good time
don't worry too much


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyy im happy for you
Bruno Dumont: baby
I'm done playing


Pretty Girl 🐦: How did it go?
Bruno Dumont: good
but my friend could only play one game
I wanted to play more


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww, any other friends who wants to play?
Bruno Dumont: not really
it was nice
now I'm sad again lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Glad you enjoyed
Awww bunbun
I think finding some other thing to do can distract you
Like giving me encouragement to pack my room
It is so difficult
Bruno Dumont: easier said then done
meant for this btw
go baby go


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel like there’s more stuff now than before I packed
Bruno Dumont: lemme help you
send me a picture


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes please
Bruno Dumont: of my present
so I can decide the best placement for it
in the boxes
so you don't have to worry about this logistics part
I think I'll give horimiya a shot now
see if that distracts me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
I thought you wanted a pic of my room
I took a pic and blurred out your gift
Bruno Dumont: I'll take that


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I’m bringing it with me ‎<This message was edited>
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: babe
I'm on the pc
I can't view the one time images


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fine
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
It’s just so messy
Bruno Dumont: babe
this jacket on the closet
I think you should take care of it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehehe
Oh I was thinking about donating it
Cuz you know, it’s just a normal jacket
Bruno Dumont: I don't think u should
I heard the owner of this jacket
is going to be very rich
in the future
you might get in trouble for that
and I also heard
he is not patient with not so good girls. he is willing to punish them severely


Pretty Girl 🐦: I will take good care of it, so I don’t get in trouble
I wear it in the mornings sometimes when it’s too cold
Bruno Dumont: too cold
or too lonely?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Can’t I be both
It doesn’t smell like bunbun anymore
Bruno Dumont: but it has my aura


Pretty Girl 🐦: True
Bruno Dumont: babe
you know what we need
we need to gift each other
something cute
and very portable
we can carry around
for when we are apart


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t wanna be apart
I like this idea though
I’ll keep this idea in mind
Bruno Dumont: we'll be
winter break
springs breaks


Pretty Girl 🐦: Shhhhhh
Shhhh
Hear no evil
Bruno Dumont: and I fear
no evil
because I'm blind
to it all
and my mind
and my gun
they confort me
and I walk besides the still waters and they
restooooooooore my sould
but I know when I die


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: my soul will be damned


Pretty Girl 🐦: Very emo song
Bruno Dumont: yeah
I got an add
more like 10
of this guy
making a show in goiania
and I was curious and looked him up
and he had this song


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo
Bruno Dumont: I got a couple ads
of stuff happening in gyn
only one I was actually interested
a comedy show from this group called 4 amigos
I like them
but I will be on campus when it happens
so a tad bit too late


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah, maybe something will happen during winter break
Bruno Dumont: its not like I care that much
I just liked the guys
specially one of them
he is prob my favorite comedian
he is called Afonso padilha
there is one called Thiago ventura
he makes jokes relatable about being poor and "de favela"
so not really my thing
there is the other one Diih lopes which makes some dark jokes I like
but I think he is the funniest


Pretty Girl 🐦: Of course
‎sticker omitted
I’m still thinking about that instagram comment about the eggs
Bruno Dumont: it is not that deep
cause this is a very clear joke
I never miss this one
whenever somone says like "eu vou comprar 5 hamburgers e dar pra todo mundo" I never miss to ask "e vai fazer oq com os hamburguers"
it is always funny


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
Bruno Dumont: whenever a joke depends on the other person to say something for you to make it its always funny
cause it only happens naturally
so it doesn't get old


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
Bruno Dumont: and I want to fuck
I'm very horny


Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too
Bruno Dumont: do you know no fap September?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I thought it was no nut November ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: in Brasil its not
sex is allowed
just not masturbation


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaoooo
Bruno Dumont: its very common
every one tried
at least one


Pretty Girl 🐦: How did it go for you?
Bruno Dumont: I haven't heard of a single person that suceeded


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
Bruno Dumont: I already lost twice


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t think even I could do it
Bruno Dumont: you could
if we had our pkace
its easy for u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well bunbun, im also horny
Idk if I can actually do a week without coming
Bruno Dumont: but you can
cause its our deal
you are doing it
today its the last day ur allowed to masturbate


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do I get a cheat day 🥺👉👈
Omg
Bruno Dumont: its not like ur gonna masturbate in your mom's friend house are u?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I already wasted most of the day
Shit, well she probably has work and stuff
Bruno Dumont: but ur not doing it
accumulate all the horniness
so I can relieve it for u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck that’s kinda hot
Great now I’m even more horny thinking about you fucking me
Oh god
Bruno Dumont: well
last day
u can still do it
Wo hen wiang ni
Wo hen ai ni


Pretty Girl 🐦: Wo ye hen ai ni bunbunn
Bruno Dumont: Wo Xian yao he ni zho ai


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha wo ye xiang
It’s so
Bruno Dumont: Ni hen how ken


Pretty Girl 🐦: It feels so heartfelt when you say you want to zuo ai
To me at least. It different than saying I wanna fuck
Bruno Dumont: Come over here and kiss me on my hot mouth
I'm feeling romantical


Pretty Girl 🐦: aww xie xie
Wo xiang qin (kiss) ni
Bruno Dumont: Wo xi juan he ni lien tien


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cute
Bruno Dumont: if you don't know where this is from search this entire sentence on youtube


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
Bro
When the 5 other dudes showed up
My jaw dropped
Bruno Dumont: I didn't know that
I only saw the first half lol
its funny to watch romance animes
cause it reminds me of how I though about love and romance in high school or before that
and its so silly lol
now things are so much simpler
I just have this one girl I love so much


Pretty Girl 🐦: What did you think about romance before?
Bruno Dumont: like the whole having crushes thing
and talking about it with your friends
and all the ordeal just to get rejected


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruh they missed out big time
Bruno Dumont: probably not


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I’m glad they did, otherwise I wouldn’t have had the chance to love bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I think I needed more time
to develop myself on my own


Pretty Girl 🐦: Probably, highschool is a very turbulent time in terms of developing our…personness
Bruno Dumont: no matter what I would always go to the us break up with any current gfs, meet u on campus and fall in love with u


Pretty Girl 🐦: current gfS
Bruno Dumont: I think I was ready for a relationship in highschool
it just didn't happen


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
Bruno Dumont: I think middle school was the problem
cause I seeked some
but at that time I didn't really understood what I like
what I value
who I am


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can relate. That was me in highscool
Bruno Dumont: I think anywhere after half of my first year in hs (sophomore year for u) would have been a good time for a relationship
but the pandemic probably made it so it wouldn't happen


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im glad you realized what you value bunbun
Bruno Dumont: yeah
good ass


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think you have a very healthy and sustainable view on relationships
Bruno Dumont: nice tities
and a pussy


Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0
Not this again
I give you a complement, and you prove me the opposite lolll
Bruno Dumont: don't be too fast in complementing me


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love you so much bunbun
It’s actually overflowing in me
Bruno Dumont: but I do think that relationships are a great way to grow as a person
if you are ready
By urself you can develop a lot of self understanding of you


Pretty Girl 🐦: If you are ready to grow from pain I think
Bruno Dumont: but in a relationship you can explore more about you in contact with others
and this contact allows you go to deeper and beyond what you could by urself


Pretty Girl 🐦: ,it takes a lot of reflection, and that’s not easy to do
Bruno Dumont: our relationship has taught me a fair share about conflict management
I used it today


Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0 im just so troublesome
Bruno Dumont: its quite the opposite


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah?
Bruno Dumont: I had a small discussion with my father
that I didn't let turn into an argument


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s awesome
Bruno Dumont: he had a critique he had to do about me and I took it
I learn it from baby girl
I also learned from baby girl
that I should be more mindfull of small things
like holding doors
that some people care about those


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww bunbunn
Bruno Dumont: and you also expanded my world view


Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you for considering my perspective
Bruno Dumont: from a perspective of someone from asia
and a woman
just small things I never considered


Pretty Girl 🐦: I learned a lot from bunbun as well
Bruno Dumont: of course I'm awesome


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mostly about communication
You really are
In the most original sense
Bruno Dumont: suck it up Crystal who is the communication master now


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
Bruno Dumont: what sense?


Pretty Girl 🐦: The strength of the adj awesome has been diluted
Bruno Dumont: so you are saying


Pretty Girl 🐦: So I mean you are awesome with the original magnitude
Bruno Dumont: I'm not just aweSOME
I'm more
so I am aweFULL


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
HAHAHA
Bruno Dumont: thanks babe
for shitting on me


Pretty Girl 🐦: lmaooo
That’s actually so funny
Bruno Dumont: who's the linguist now?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Still me
Bruno Dumont: fuck off


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: that made me giggle
thanks for making me feel better
now send me a picture of you


Pretty Girl 🐦: I glad I could do that for bunbun
Bruno Dumont: so I can remember how pretty u are
I'm so excited to learn chinese
If I really like it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayyyyyy
Bruno Dumont: one day we can learn a language together
what do you think?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I would be very into that
Bruno Dumont: okay
we should make it a competition


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hell yeah
I ain’t losing to bunbun on language learning
Bruno Dumont: but I'll only do that


Pretty Girl 🐦: But I’m scared
Bruno Dumont: after I finish chinese


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz bunbun is strangely good at Chinese
Bruno Dumont: by finish I mean get good enough to be able to learn just by talking with you
and so we can make it fair
we should
learn spanish
that's the only language it will be a fair fight
but I know you don't really like it
so we can change that


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think Spanish is the most practical one, but maybe not the most fun
Bruno Dumont: I also think that
its the most usefull one
it would be my clear go to
low commitment
high reward
but we can decide it as a team
when the time comes
if the time comes


Pretty Girl 🐦: It will
Bruno Dumont: I might completely hate language learning
I'm not promessing anything
other than give it a genuine try


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im just glad you are considering it so seriously
And taking a freaking Chinese class
Makes me very happy
Bruno Dumont: I loved learning it
I love trying to squeeze my tiny vocab
to make sentences


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
I think you have a good brain setup for language learning
Bruno Dumont: Wǒ zhīdào woda vocab hen xiao


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha
Bruno Dumont: but
Wo zhīdào woda dial hen da


Pretty Girl 🐦: dan shi
Hahahahahahha
Bruno Dumont: that's what matters in the end


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, your sentence doesn’t make sense
Bruno Dumont: babe


Pretty Girl 🐦: Da means big
Bruno Dumont: its the dial dicl
and the dial feet
the same word
different tone
or is it different sound?


Pretty Girl 🐦: diao is dick, jiao is feet
Bruno Dumont: I know that babe


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s actually the same tone, different sound
Bruno Dumont: got it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was trying to joke it doesn’t make sense to say your dick is big
Bruno Dumont: I thought it was this just wanted to make sure I understood what tone meant
you need to make your joke more clear
you could have gone for
babe da is big didn't you meant xiao
or just
xiao*


Pretty Girl 🐦: Not gonna admit your joke execution is better than mine
Bruno Dumont: its okay babe
you don't need to admit
I already know
and besides its an unfair comparison


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: cause you have sentences execution
I have joke execution
its different


Pretty Girl 🐦: Im happy with that
Bruno Dumont: I meant
u can't make a joke
all you do is say sentences
baby
I love you
I think ur funny
in your way
but more important than that


Pretty Girl 🐦: You better think I’m funny
Bruno Dumont: you always create funny situations
that I can make funny jokes
and your sense of humor
makes you laugh at everything I say
and always lets me confortable
to be unapologetically myself
cause I rather listen to your laugh


Pretty Girl 🐦: our humor matches well
Bruno Dumont: and see your smile


Pretty Girl 🐦: I love your jokes. They really make my days better
Wanna hug bunbun
Bruno Dumont: okay

Bruno Dumont: and you said bad things about me


Pretty Girl 🐦: Very bad
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: did u finish your packing?


Pretty Girl 🐦: …no
Bruno Dumont: well


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’ll try to finish tonight
Bruno Dumont: maybe you don't like my ass enough


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do. I really do
It’s just too many things
And I get confused about how to optimize ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: babe
how does china handle first and last names


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun
Bruno Dumont: cause in anime I find it intreaguind


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s similar to Japan
Bruno Dumont: how like apparently you call every one by their last name
and only very close people by the first


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok it’s not similar to Japan in that sense
I just call my friends by their full name
Which I think is what most people do
Bruno Dumont: Han Fei yi


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz Chinese names are short af
Bruno Dumont: sorry I always forget how to write it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, han fengyi
Hey Bruno de moraes Dumont
Bruno Dumont: but do you say the last name first?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
Bruno Dumont: de Moraes Dumont Bruno
I don't mind capitalization
but if you are going to use it
put it in the M too
and void the d in de


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yessir
Bruno Dumont: well
why the fuck
is the *LAST* name not last


Pretty Girl 🐦: Are you saying Chinese culture is wrong??? ‎<This message was edited>
You’re cancelled because of your question
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: babe
its wrong
its not my fault
‎You deleted this message.


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s not wrongg
: 0
0 :
Bruno Dumont: hahaha I erased all the proof


Pretty Girl 🐦: I was a second too late
Cuz I was gonna respond to it
Bruno Dumont: you always are


Pretty Girl 🐦: And cement the proof ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: I'm always one step ahead


Pretty Girl 🐦: You might think you are, but that’s exactly where I want you to be
that's when I’ll be right behind you. And at no time will you be anywhere other than exactly where I want you to be.
Bunbunn, when are you flying back home for winter break?

First youtube video I see
Just proving his point

Pretty Girl 🐦: Morning bunbunnn
Bruno Dumont: Sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: Very interesting that you dreamed about another woman :) now tell me bout the creepy dream

Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted

Pretty Girl 🐦: Can you explain more what he’s talking about
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_agUHEN5Mp/?igsh=NHA3YnNyOHV5aGR3


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s just like you see a lot of Americans wearing the shirt no
Which I always do in the dining hall
Bruno Dumont: He is saying its a trend
For woman to wear brasilian shirts
And I wouldn’t have sent u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Intriguing
Bruno Dumont: But the next video I open
Its an american girl
Using a brasil t-shirt
So I thought it was funny


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol
I feel him
Why you send me this
Bruno Dumont: I thought it was cool
For u to learn some expressions
They are all very natural
I used them all at a regulat basis
Except for the mamão com açúcar
That one is more old people


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I got a not very cool vibe from that one
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_Yxc54yvSH/?igsh=MWlhcm9sYXNsYXJ3bA==
Its normal though mamão com açúcar its papaya with sugar


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
Eu sei porque aprendi todas as frutas com agripino
Bruno Dumont: Nossa
Isso eh muito sexy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lmaooooo
Bruno Dumont: Eu tenho muito tesao em mulheres que aprendem os nomes de frutas com o agripino


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
Good thing I’m the only one
How would you say this in port?
xxxx que sou o único
Bruno Dumont: Que bom que eu sou a única
Or
Eu amo chupar pika
It depends on the formality


Pretty Girl 🐦: Eu amo de verdade
Na verdade?
bruh I can never tell
Bruno Dumont: Correct
Na verdade its when you are refuting something
Eu vou hoje


Pretty Girl 🐦: Refuting?
Bruno Dumont: Na verdade
Não vou


Pretty Girl 🐦: ohhhhhh
I see
Bruno Dumont: Tenho que ir buscar minha avo no muai thai


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
Bruno Dumont: De verdade is an affirmation
Eu te amo
De verdade

Pretty Girl 🐦: Food was soo good 😭😭😭
I haven’t had Chinese food for so long
And she gave me sparking water
Omg I was so conflicted because she offered me a drink, I saw that it had *30g* of sugar
I felt so bad because I didn’t want it, but then she also offered me a ginger sparkling water
Quero fazer isso https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_Y_rLzOVay/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Bunbun’s Chinese skills after fall https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_XfzjcAHar/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
I miss bunbun :(
Bruno Dumont: I’m so glad
You’ll never have this problem with me
If you don’t want something you can always jusy say it
No matter what it is
That’s cringe af


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbunnnn good morning
Bruno Dumont: Good morning babe
I finished making my character


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yayy
Bruno Dumont: how are u?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Not amazing
Bruno Dumont: o no baby
what happened?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I slept really badly
Bruno Dumont: anything you can use a bunbun on?


Pretty Girl 🐦: I do want a bunbun hug
And now I’m a bit nauseous cuz lack of sleep
Do you ever get that
Bruno Dumont: but babe

Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun

Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok
I just didn’t want to be criticized rn lol
Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry

‎sticker omitted
Giving bunbun a hug rn
Mentally
Bruno Dumont: giving you two hugs
I won


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll
I can’t believe I found someone who loves winning more than me ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: come on
you are not even that competitive


Pretty Girl 🐦: I hide it better
It’s a strategy
Bruno Dumont: you can only hide it
if you are not that competitive


Pretty Girl 🐦: To get you to lower your guard
So I can win more muahahha
Bruno Dumont: its not working
clearly


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
But I do agree I got less competitive over the years
Because I realized winning doesn’t matter as much as getting what you want out of the experience
And sometimes what’s valuable to you isn’t “winnin”
Bruno Dumont: yeah
that's what all losers say


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Oh god, the nausea is back
Only a true bunbun’s kiss can save me
Bruno Dumont: kiss kiss kiss


Pretty Girl 🐦: Eu tô cured
Bruno Dumont: curada

Pretty Girl 🐦: Eu adoro quando ce compliment meu português ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: elogia

Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww that’s cute
Bruno Dumont: its better to use vc

Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck
Bruno Dumont: that's more how you would read it lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m a failure
Bruno Dumont: but its fine

Pretty Girl 🐦: I should just stop speaking
Bruno Dumont: vc sabe que eu te amo

Pretty Girl 🐦: I bring shame to the language learning community ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: cala a boca
piranha
voce bring shame porra nenhuma


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah

Bruno Dumont: vergonha

Bruno Dumont: Babe
I recorded a podcast
Then I did an QnA
And now I’m on a surprise string theory class
‎image omitted
With probably one of thr best physicists in Brasil
And I got a ride on a bmw


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s so cool
Bruno Dumont: Not really
I know this guy
He is very bad at explaining things to people who don’t know it


Pretty Girl 🐦: omg bunbun is a red pill podcost host now 😭
Loll
Bruno Dumont: So he is teaching things and expecting people to understand what they can’t
It’s quite boring


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah I can relate to that
Bruno Dumont: And there is one guy


Pretty Girl 🐦: Still a cool experience tho
Bruno Dumont: Who is enjoying it


Pretty Girl 🐦: I wish I could that in my highschool
Bruno Dumont: And he kinda kidnapped the whole thing
So he can learn string theory
I respect his balls to ask for it
Cause having a class from this guy it’s really an oportunity
But I didn’t like
I can explain in more details later
But I liked recording the podcast
It was fire
It was just a convo with friends
About thing I love to talk about


Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha nice of him to take the opportunity

Of course babe
Any time


Pretty Girl 🐦: Good morning bunbunnn
Fascinating
Did you watch my reels?
Bruno Dumont: not all


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bad bunbun
Bruno Dumont: now I did


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmm that was too fast
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: I only missed one


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
Bruno Dumont: cause I was watching them
then I scrolled down
and forgot to watch the last one lol
cute


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you feel like the cat is a little…ugly?
Bruno Dumont: compared to you
yes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hehe
have you been able to plan your course?
Bruno Dumont: I haven't tried


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can't find a lot of my classes
really strange
oh i see, they are just slowly adding more
Bruno Dumont: finished planning
found all of my classes
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Btw, this ling class satisfied edp
‎image omitted
Bruno Dumont: are u taking it now?
cause I might be up for taking it next quarter with u


Pretty Girl 🐦: I planned it for fall because it overlaps with 107 in the winter
Bruno Dumont: it overlaps with chinlang


Pretty Girl 🐦: Well fuck
Bruno Dumont: and with 111 in winter


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hey, if you find another intésting edp course, I’ll take it with you
Bruno Dumont: you're already taking this one right?
so no need for u to take another one


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s fine, if I think the course is also interesting, I would be happy to take it
Bruno Dumont: well
I really hope you wouldn't find it interesting
cause that would show a severe mental disability from your side


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do I look like my brain is high function
‎sticker omitted
Bruno Dumont: my friends character
in dnd
has down syndrome


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why?
Bruno Dumont: just cause he wanted it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh interesting
Bruno Dumont: but I'm glad our team looks good
my character is all abou the stealth and dark
but his character didn't have stealth or darkvision
so he would completely fuck me over
but the other guy chose a character that grants darkvision to their allies
and so now we can all go in the dark


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cool!
Bruno Dumont: and how the rules normally are
if the party is going stealth
and somone fucks up the stealth
the entire group is fucked
but the dm allowed us to take an avarage
so as long as I'm very good I can make up for a very bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds great
‎sticker omitted
‎image omitted
have you seen the Minecraft movie trailer?
Bruno Dumont: No
Is it good?

Cwispy
Bruno Dumont: Nice translation
I saw ur reflection lol
Nice


Pretty Girl 🐦: Great, now I got bored cuz it’s giving hentai vibes
Bruno Dumont: Watch a sign of affection
I really liked it
Or bunny girl
Its gonna feel like hentai
For the first 5 minutes
But I promise it’s not
Not a lot of fan service


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, I’ll check them out both
Omg she hot af
Bruno Dumont: Who?


Pretty Girl 🐦: The bunny girl
Bruno Dumont: May?
I really like this anime
It peaks in the third episode


Pretty Girl 🐦: Idk her name yet
Bruno Dumont: For me
And gets very good at the end too


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awesome
Bruno Dumont: Its a nice anime


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m excited
Bruno Dumont: The film its also fire af


Pretty Girl 🐦: I like the music
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-6RToLRcpD/?igsh=MWZibWtvNXIydWkwbA==
Babe
Its so hard
To choose a gift for you
But I think I did a great job this time


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m liking the bunny girl anime
Is Mai tied to this dude somehow? Like she only exists when he observes her?
Nah, no she’s not
That did happen in a web novel I read, where this character’s world would only generate when this other person is around
And he would get snow blindness, cuz the ungenerated world was just pure white
Omg im gonna cry, he forgot her 😭😭
Omg
Thank you very much bunbun
I’m sure I will like it a lot
Bruno Dumont: I think you will


Pretty Girl 🐦: Xie xie bunbunnn
Bruno Dumont: I think this one is very hit or miss ‎<This message was edited>


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I also hope you like my gift
Bruno Dumont: But this is not “mine”
I just helped choosing it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Also I totally didn’t cry on ep 2 of this anime
Oooo
Bruno Dumont: Lol
I’m glad you liked it so much
Its one of my favorites
I told you it’s worth it to hold on the “hentai” part in the beginning


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh it was actually ep 3
Loll
Bruno Dumont: I told you
It peaks on ep 3
Its prob the best 3 episodes of an anime
‎image omitted

Is there anything else you dad likes?
Does he like tea?
Bruno Dumont: Old cars

Eu sou a velocidade ‎<This message was edited>

We can have one
Potentially


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah maybe
Bruno Dumont: We can go to a cat place for u to pet them all
Then we come back home
And chill with no cats


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds great
Bruno Dumont: But
Having a pet


Pretty Girl 🐦: I hope the place doesn’t smell
Bruno Dumont: Can help with loneliness


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Yeah I think that’s why these two tenants have them
Bruno Dumont: Maybe it will be a more appealing option to me in the future


Pretty Girl 🐦: They got them over the pandemic apparently
Not happening
Bruno Dumont: Okay babe
I don’t mind at all
I was saying that in the case you wanted a pet


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh I just mean like
Bruno Dumont: You know how I feel about animals


Pretty Girl 🐦: You won’t need a pet for loneliness
Cuz I won’t let bunbun feel alone
Bruno Dumont: You know that there is only so much you can do right?
I love you
But you are a partner
I need other people in my life
For the sake of us


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah..
Yep, I really hope we both have friends as adults as well
Bruno Dumont: But babe
Your a good fit
For the cat obsessed old lady


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahahah
I agree
I would be the type to walk their cats outdoors
Bruno Dumont: And treat them as humans
If someone comes interact with u
You’ll ask them to talk with the cats
Cause rn you already do that


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha
Bruno Dumont: But you stop yourself out of embarrassment
But old people lose the embarrassment


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s rude to not say hi
Bruno Dumont: Is this accurate?

I’m so lucky to have such a great partner
I love bunbun, I miss talking to you in person

Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_gFNDDIN9Y/?igsh=Y2E5NDh0ZWx2ejR5
Babe
there is a magic item in dnd
that is the emotional support plushy
that allows you to once a day have advantage to resist being frightned
Good morning babe
you are almost here
I can feel your presence already
just wanted to give you a good morning
I have good news
the things I did on my intership
I can put it in a resume as a very complete experience


Pretty Girl 🐦: good morning bunbunnn

that's awesome! I'm glad it turned out to be useful experience
Bruno Dumont: prob not

Bruno Dumont: Tbh not to that extent

It was a promise to you
I’d do everything in my power
To keep this alive

Pretty Girl 🐦: Satisfying to peel off though
But maybe that’s not the recommended move
Nope
Bruno Dumont: I was peeling it off
by giving myself a massage
but it was ineficient


Pretty Girl 🐦: save some for me?
Bruno Dumont: so I asked a couple girls to give me the massage


Pretty Girl 🐦: naoooooooooo
Bruno Dumont: but their hands were hurting
so they used their chest instead


Pretty Girl 🐦: bunbunnnnnnnn
you better save some for me
Bruno Dumont: no
I'll save all for u


Pretty Girl 🐦: hehe, now im happy
imagining other girls touch you and seeing you naked is

Can I ask for a favor?

If you could choose the perfect day with me. It doesn’t need to be realistic the absolute best day ever with lots of details
What would it be


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like what would we do?
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
What would the schedule be
For the absolute perfect day for u


Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmm lemme think about this
You should answer this questions as well
I wanna know
Bruno Dumont: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_g8kF-NQ2w/?igsh=MTNqOXFmb3I3aGs0Ng==
Noooooo
My baby is gone
Me so sad
Baby has internet
Babe I’m gonna try to catch some sleep soon
2 tips for u
1) try to sleep rn if possible to get used to the time zone
2) when u arrive in the airport keep your eyes on your luggage all the time. If you need to sleep try to entangle your stuff to you
Sleep with your legs in your luggage and your backpack between your arms or under your head
It’s not that dangerous but better safe then sorry
Other than that have a good trip very excited to see you tomorrow
I can’t sleep
Cause I’m too excited to see you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Omg I made it
They didn’t have WiFi 😭
Aww bunbun, im so excited to see you too
I tried, but I didn’t sleep well :(
Ok

This class
Was so dog water
It was the slowest syllabus reading of all time


Pretty Girl 🐦: sounds like torture
Bruno Dumont: It kinda was
I’m looking at suplementa
Some weight gainers
Some have 1.2 k calories per serving
And they recommend taking once or twice per day
Like wtf


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is that, can you body even take in that much energy? ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: Yeah
Some people eat upwards of 10k calories a day
I might buy something on those lines
But only eat half a serving
I’ll research first though


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, hopefully they are completely safe to take
Bruno Dumont: I think they are
Its just like the whey protein
But they add calories too
Last time I took it that made me a little sick
Like wanting to throw up
Because my body was not used to that much calories so fast
So I’m gonna start slowly to get used to it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Mm, good plan
Bruno Dumont: I’ll like drink 200 calories


Pretty Girl 🐦: Where would you be able to buy them?
Bruno Dumont: For 3 days
Then 400
Then like 600
And prob stop there


Pretty Girl 🐦: Sounds good

I can buy online too

Like every shoulder pain I have
Chest exercises are what injure shoulders the most

If I could just skip shoulder I would

he made a good cover letter for me
I think it is still a bit cheesy
but it looks good


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s awesome!
How did you prompt it?
Bruno Dumont: I asked it to give me a guide on how to make a cover letter
then I asked it to follow that guide and write me a cover letter focusing on scouting the internet for information about the specific company (in this case duolingo) and to use information from the job description and resume I pasted
then I asked for improvements based on what I saw was bad


Pretty Girl 🐦: I like your strategy
Bruno Dumont: Asking for a guide then asking it to use the guide
Makes it more likely to follow it
And not just write whatever


Pretty Girl 🐦: Where meet?

Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted

Pretty Girl 🐦: How is it absurd
Bruno Dumont: I'm just mistranslating portuguese

my first job


Pretty Girl 🐦: Congrats bunbun!!
very happy for ya
Which one was this?
Bruno Dumont: Meta


Pretty Girl 🐦: Very cool
Bruno Dumont: they didn't give the option of cover letters
or small essays
so I sent it


Pretty Girl 🐦: As companies should be
This is not as impressive, but I just had a break through with my Phil 80 paper
That I’ve been thinking about for 2 days
Bruno Dumont: it is more impressive
I just filled my name and stuff like that
having a break through is more impressive
it will be more impressive if I get the job


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
You put in a lot behind the scene, which deserves big acknowledgment
Bruno Dumont: but it is crazy
how they expect so much of us
like they expect us to have 3 work experiences
by the end of the first year of college?
and this is an endless run
because I had great achievements ngl my Olympiad results were impressive
but I need to leverage them into more impressive achievements
cause in 3 years they are worthless
I leveraged them into a top tier university


Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: not if I don't leverage it into more job experiences
it is all worthless
and I have to leverage those interships into more internships and more jobs


Pretty Girl 🐦: This is a problem we will all have, because we have high expectations of ourselves paired with high ability
Bruno Dumont: I'm not fully complaining
I like the fact I have achievements in the past
and now I'm using them to get more


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it would feel better if we find positions/jobs we actually enjoy
Bruno Dumont: it's just different from how I thought it would be
I though if you are impressive that's kinda the end goal


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, but we are very young still
Bruno Dumont: you get into Stanford than the rest will easily follow through from your great achievement


Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t wanna peak in college
Loll
Bruno Dumont: I'll explain more in person


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok
Bruno Dumont: that's not what I meant


Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m dying in this class
It’s so hot
Bruno Dumont: ‎image omitted

Pretty Girl 🐦: What is worth of praise to you?
Bruno Dumont: And sometimes getting a complement when I feel like its not worth jt
Can even Feel like an insult ‎<This message was edited>
Sometimes


Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you have an example
I’m trying to understand how you feel
Bruno Dumont: Like u complementing my cover letter
Or in hs when I got silver on the olimpiad
And my mom tried complementing me
Or complementing me for getting waitlisted or in a safety college
But when I try for something
When its a thing I put effort
And I think I deserve praise
I get a bit sad when I don’t receive it


Pretty Girl 🐦: It seems you are affect more by the end result
Bruno Dumont: Like this just flew right through me head


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like, you put in effort in your cover letter, in applying to safety colleges
Bruno Dumont: Cause it didn’t feel like something I was expecting a complement for
Not just end result
But expectation


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah
Bruno Dumont: I didn’t put effort in the cover letter
And I didn’t put effort into getting to a safety
I put effort in getting gold pr stanford
That just happened
It was just a consolation prize
We can talk more in person
But that’s why I like when people say I’m funny
Cause I put effort in it
And I think its worth praising


Pretty Girl 🐦: Alright bunbun
I think this is something you will have to communicate more clearly with me
Btw bunbun, you should check if you are on the 15-meal plan
Cuz that’s the default, and I had trouble scanning for lunch

Bruno Dumont: Baby
I need you to remind me how to say or in Chinese
and teach me more
Here’s a list of 50 useful Chinese words to learn that will help you in most daily conversations:


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oki doki
huò 或 ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: 在 (zài) - to be at, in
those are the ones I didn't know
we should try to learn them all
可以我们桌哎今天吗？


Pretty Girl 🐦: 可以，非常可以 （ké yǐ，fēi cháng ké yǐ）
But we need more
uhh Venus thingys
I don’t remember the name in Portuguese
Bruno Dumont: Eu nn entendi porra nenhuma
Can, "Feijao" can
that's all I understood from your sentence


Pretty Girl 🐦: You asked pode fazer sexo, I answered pode, muito pode
Why does this make more sense in portugese than English
Bruno Dumont: it makes no sense in Portuguese either
and why is muito neither Hen not Thai
vai se fuder para essa lingua muito dificil credo
credo fml tankei foi nothing


Pretty Girl 🐦: Because tai is an adj
fei chang is an adv
It’s not very grammatical for me to say this
I should not have said this
Muito = hěn
Bruno Dumont: baby
is it gramatical of you
to fuck me?
Qǐn wèn, nín shì lǎoshī ma?

Bruno Dumont: Second-year Symbolic Systems student at Stanford University with a concentration in Natural Language, with a strong foundation in critical thinking, cultural analysis, and programming. My passion for language and human-computer interaction led me to pursue this interdisciplinary degree, where I explore the intersection of technology, communication, and society.

The coding test? Or interview with person
Bruno Dumont: I finished it
the coding test
I had to cheat lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awesome!
Bruno Dumont: the coding part wasn't trivial
it was easy to make a braindead solution
that just works but its slow
but I'm pretty sure I found the most optimal solution
in like 5 minutes


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s amazing bunbun
You are so smart
Bruno Dumont: but the other question was on SQL
which is a think I know nothing about


Pretty Girl 🐦: Uh oh
Bruno Dumont: I can't even explain what that is
but chatgpt solved it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Loll I’m glad
Bruno Dumont: if I have an interview with IBM I'm gonna learn SQL
before the interview


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah it’s always good to look up what the tests cover
Or what interview questions they like to ask
Bruno Dumont: I told you I would have time to learn it on the spot

Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha ok I’m willing to take a look
Eu sou esperta ‎<This message was edited>
Bruno Dumont: esperta*


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah exactly
Bruno Dumont: basically the question is a not so trivial coding question
but if you think about the problem in a mathematical way
and find the optimal solution
the coding part becames trivial


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruno
I feel a little clingy today
Maybe cuz I’m in pain (period stuff)

Pretty Girl 🐦: : 0

Bruno Dumont: I like shoulders in me in men
but in you
I like the more feminine traits


Pretty Girl 🐦: I think shoulders look good on anyone
Bruno Dumont: I think a good shoulder is a great adition
but its not what I will look at
what will catch my attention


Pretty Girl 🐦: I can’t wait to go back to the gym with you

Bruno Dumont: lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: haha jokes aside
Bruno Dumont: that's what google translate said to me lol

Pretty Girl 🐦: Of course!
Bruno Dumont: we can make our own games
like the mind was super fun
we can make it
we can make the psychologist game too


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes, I was thinking about making secret hitler
But that’s much more cumbersome
Bruno Dumont: I just have to ask chat gpt to generate the ideas and then filter them and print them out


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah! Or even like white board/marker options
That can be easily modified
Idk
We will solve that when we need to
Bruno Dumont: what do you mean?
white board/marker?


Pretty Girl 🐦: like teletrations
Bruno Dumont: I want it


Pretty Girl 🐦: Cuz if we print them, we can’t change them
Bruno Dumont: how about we take some time to go make it together
for the mind is not a problem


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah that sounds awesome
Are you thinking of making cards?
Bruno Dumont: yeah

I could just cut the paper
and put numbers on it
but I wanted something better lol

Ain’t nothing wrong about expressing how we feel

Bruno Dumont: babe

so I thought you already went for dinner anywat


Pretty Girl 🐦: If I did that, I wouldn’t keep asking you

Next time just answer my questions please bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry


Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s ok. I’m sorry for pushing my anger on you ‎<This message was edited>

Bruno Dumont: I got this message on the brasil group


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh loll
Bruno Dumont: Babe
I finished that thing
in 9 minutes
I had 90 lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: My gosh
Bruno Dumont: I spend 20 more minutes making sure everything was correct
wrote comments
deleted the comments


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s awesome bunbun
Lollll
Bruno Dumont: cause I thought it wasn't looking good
wrote additional test cases
had a huge issue with that
because of the shitty way they codded their auto grader
it was saing that the input [[1,2,3,4],"ETTE"] was different then [[1,2,3,4], "ETTE"]
because they way they codded the space between the inputs was read as part of the string
took me a while to figure out
but I did
it was much easier than the practice lol


Pretty Girl 🐦: Bruhhh
Bunbun so smart
I wanna hear about the problem
Bruno Dumont: you can do both
at the same time
one hand each
while telling me all about the birds


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
Btw more bird facts for you
This one is about morris
Bruno Dumont: byebye

Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m very excited bunbunnnn

Bruno Dumont: I'm gonna start mass preparing your stuff rn


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
Lemme know if you need any help
Thank you very much bunbun for preparing something for me
Bruno Dumont: You would be
Of great help
But I can’t ask lol
I’m not a functional member of society
Without you


Pretty Girl 🐦: Awww, I do want to help you
But I also like the mystery
What a dilemma
Haha yes you need leadership from the bunbun leader
Bruno Dumont: I finished a small thing
reached out to Ernesto about the job
and applied to a job at waymo


Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn you are really productive
Bruno Dumont: the small thing is for tomorrow


Pretty Girl 🐦: I really hope the internships work out for you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: I really hope this works out

Pretty Girl 🐦: I will still like it if it doesn’t bunbun
Bruno Dumont: we have the same vocab


Pretty Girl 🐦: lol, you always copy me
I’ll take it as a compliment 😚
Bruno Dumont: babe
that's fucking insane
‎image omitted


Pretty Girl 🐦: Why not
Loll
Bruno Dumont: a gap year?


Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s apparently what Ernesto is doing
Bruno Dumont: there is definitely a million reasons why not
is not an easy thing
to just stop my life as it is
for an year


Pretty Girl 🐦: Stanford loves that shit, you can take so many years of absence
That’s true bunbun
It might not be worth it for you
Bruno Dumont: but it might be too
I don't know


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ask if a summer is ok first
Bruno Dumont: headstarting me into having a job
what do you mean?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Like summer internship
Bruno Dumont: he said its not possible for an internship


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah I see
Learn more about the startup from him
See if you feel like it’s a promising idea
Idk, if it pays well, looks like it has potential, and wants you, I would give it consideration
And talk to a ton of people for suggestions (academic advisor, people who took gap years, etc)
But take my thoughts with a grain of salt, I get impulsive sometimes
Bruno Dumont: I asked my mom
and she said it was a crazy idea
heavily against it


Pretty Girl 🐦: How do you feel about that?
Bruno Dumont: are u prepared to live away from me again?


Pretty Girl 🐦: No I don’t want you to go
Bruno Dumont: lol
but you still recommend I do?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Especially for a whole year
I would consider it, if I had this opportunity
Bruno Dumont: you really love me hum
putting my needs
above your need for bunbun
that's very sweet of you


Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
I do really love you bunbun
Bruno Dumont: but it would be very different
I can get a Caltrain pass
and see you every weekend
but I'm leaning towards no


Pretty Girl 🐦: Have you asked Ernesto about the startup?
I’m really curious what they are doing
Idk if he can tell you much
Bruno Dumont: he didn't reply yey

I just discovered
that I have a psych midterm on monday
my project milestone is next friday
and my pset is due in a couple days
I think I'm cooked
as they would say
the only logic solution is to get scared of how much work I have and procrastinate by playing braw stars


Pretty Girl 🐦: Aw bunbun, this week is tough but we can get through together ‎<This message was edited>

Pretty Girl 🐦: I trust you will figure it out bunbun

Bruno Dumont: whats up?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Just wanted to say your name 😚
Bruno Dumont: babe
I'm going to fail
my midterm
for 229


Pretty Girl 🐦: Is it very hard?
Bruno Dumont: I'm looking at some extra practice midterms
and it looks super hard


Pretty Girl 🐦: I felt the same when looking at 106b midterms, but the real one wasn’t that hard
I hope you will have the same experience
Bruno Dumont: yeah
I don't think so
cause god help me this is the case
but I think that 106B is designed to be doable
but I think this is not the case
I think its designed for the students to do half of it on avarage


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ah I see
Bruno Dumont: Cause that's all I can do


Pretty Girl 🐦: Don’t have too much pressure
Bruno, would you like dinner together?
Im a little hungry, might go at 6
Bruno Dumont: Oki
Have you heard of atheism?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Yessir

I'm studying linguistics rn
I'm studying semantic propositions
on languages


Pretty Girl 🐦: Oooooo in English?
Bruno Dumont: no


Pretty Girl 🐦: Or like the phenomenon
Bruno Dumont: in a new alphabet


Pretty Girl 🐦: For…machines?
Bruno Dumont: yup


Pretty Girl 🐦: When would machines need prepositions?
Bruno Dumont: a semantic proposition is a proposition over a turing machine that operates in an alphabet that is consistent across the language and is non-trivial
its a proposition not a preposition


Pretty Girl 🐦: Ohhhh
lol I misread
Yes I think we covered this in ling one
Bruno Dumont: wtf?
you covered turing machines in ling one?


Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll, of course not
Just the propositions part ‎<This message was edited>
This is random but, I can’t stop hiccuping
Bruno Dumont: hold ur breath
that happens because your diafragma is not in sync with your lungs
holding your breath makes them start working in sync again
