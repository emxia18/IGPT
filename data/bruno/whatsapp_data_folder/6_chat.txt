[12/23/23, 7:38:35 AM] Bruno Dumont: How’s break going?
[12/24/23, 7:37:30 AM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: It has been going well. My family and I are celebrating Christmas tonight at my house, which should be nice. How are you? I hope you are feeling better!

[12/25/23, 9:23:24 AM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: Merry Christmas!
[12/25/23, 9:23:40 AM] Bruno Dumont: Merry Christmas man
[12/25/23, 9:25:44 AM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: We should definitely go back to the shopping center again. I felt so bad about leaving you dying, but I'm glad you're okay.
[12/25/23, 9:26:00 AM] Bruno Dumont: Don’t worry man
[12/25/23, 9:26:03 AM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: Are you doing anything for the holidays?

[12/25/23, 9:26:26 AM] Bruno Dumont: Just family
[12/25/23, 9:27:52 AM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: Nice! Me too. It has been relaxing to be free from schoolwork, but I look forward to heading back and seeing friends again!

[7/8/24, 7:38:44 PM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: Oi Bruno! Como é você? Já encontrou um projeito ou um trabalho?
[7/9/24, 2:15:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: Hey John how are you?
[7/9/24, 2:15:43 PM] Bruno Dumont: I didn't find anything yet

[7/9/24, 2:15:53 PM] Bruno Dumont: how are things going for you?
[7/9/24, 2:16:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: Oi Bruno! Como voce esta?
[7/9/24, 2:16:43 PM] Bruno Dumont: when you want to ask how I am doing you need to use the temporary form of the verb to be which is estar and you use it after the pronoun
[7/10/24, 6:58:21 PM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: Not bad. I'm learning a ton about the Mexican Revolution, and my job has been extremely chill (they've been paying me to sit around and read a book).
[7/10/24, 6:59:09 PM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: Ah... as you can see, my Portuguese is a little rough. Will have to work on that before you return.
[7/30/24, 3:19:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: Fala John beleza?
[7/30/24, 3:20:07 PM] Bruno Dumont: Como cê ta?
[7/30/24, 3:20:21 PM] Bruno Dumont: We haven’t talked in such a long time
[7/30/24, 3:20:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: How are things going
[7/30/24, 3:20:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: ?
[8/1/24, 11:59:19 AM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: Muito bom! I've been going to Berkeley almost every day this week to view some of their archives and am having fun with that! I've also been doing a lot of biking and trying to learn French.
[8/1/24, 11:59:24 AM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: How about you?
[8/13/24, 1:25:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: Doing good too
[8/13/24, 1:25:18 PM] Bruno Dumont: Got a job last minute so now I’m working on that
[8/13/24, 1:25:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: Now busy choosing classes
[8/13/24, 1:25:31 PM] Bruno Dumont: Any plans for the fall?
[9/8/24, 1:13:13 PM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: Just registered for courses. I'm planning on doing Math 116 and 220, although I just found out that Math 120 isn't offered in the winter, which might throw my schedule off.
[9/8/24, 1:14:38 PM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: Ideally, I'll take it in the Spring, but if none of my friends do 220 in the fall, I might end up doing it in the Fall.
[9/8/24, 1:14:54 PM] John Vaccaro Stanford Math 61: How did registration go for you?
