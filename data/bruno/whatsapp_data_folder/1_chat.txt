[9/23/23, 7:59:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: You won

[9/23/23, 7:59:34 PM] Bruno Dumont: Lol
[9/23/23, 7:59:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: I’m just too tired
[9/23/23, 7:59:50 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Fuck, I was just about to text you something
[9/23/23, 8:00:03 PM] Bruno Dumont: I can text though

[9/23/23, 8:00:08 PM] Bruno Dumont: Just dont wanna get out of bed
[9/23/23, 8:00:17 PM] Bruno Dumont: No worries
[9/23/23, 8:00:20 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok you ready, it’s a bit long
[9/23/23, 8:00:34 PM] Bruno Dumont: Just let it out
[9/23/23, 8:00:50 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I think we should stay friends. You are a pretty great human being and anyone would be lucky to have you; we just don’t fit other very well romantically.
[9/23/23, 8:01:07 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: For one, I’m still learning to communicate and identify my feelings, and my improvements are too slow for what you and me need.
[9/23/23, 8:01:36 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I also feel like most times we focus on your enjoyment but not my enjoyment. I pushed myself to go check out parties and sports games cuz I wanted to hang out with you and I thought it would make you happy, even though I don’t enjoy these things. I’m giving up too much in exchange to hang out with you. I also want to prioritize my own happiness now.
[9/23/23, 8:02:09 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: So yeah, if we keep the option of dating open, I would feel pressure to do thing I don’t enjoy to hang out with you. It is not your fault, since ultimately it is my choice. But I honestly think it would benefit both of us to just be friends. You would feel less pressure as well I think. 

I still want to hang out with you (and I enjoy going to the gym and playing chess and just chatting with you), just on my own terms without the pressure I put on myself to please you.
[9/23/23, 8:02:39 PM] Bruno Dumont: Ok then
[9/23/23, 8:02:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: I was thinking about it as well
[9/23/23, 8:02:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: It was a great try though
[9/23/23, 8:03:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: At least you got out your first kiss
[9/23/23, 8:03:18 PM] Bruno Dumont: Dont worry about it
[9/23/23, 8:03:32 PM] Bruno Dumont: You shoudnt to it
[9/23/23, 8:03:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: I just didnt realize you disliked it so much
[9/23/23, 8:04:06 PM] Bruno Dumont: I also dont do it too often I just was experiencing something new
[9/23/23, 8:04:12 PM] Bruno Dumont: And i kinda liked it
[9/23/23, 8:04:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: Lets just be friends than nothing will really change
[9/23/23, 8:04:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: From how it was a few days ago
[9/23/23, 8:05:03 PM] Bruno Dumont: I promisse not to make things akward

[9/23/23, 8:08:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: I was thinking about it as well
[9/23/23, 8:09:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: I think that if we had taked it more far
[9/23/23, 8:09:40 PM] Bruno Dumont: I would end up having a relationship that doesn’t satisfy what I need
[9/23/23, 8:09:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: And the breakup would be very harsh
[9/23/23, 8:10:32 PM] Bruno Dumont: Now that the window is closed I can talk about how I experienced relationships more openly
[9/23/23, 8:10:51 PM] Bruno Dumont: Its just that I dont talk about exs with people I’m hitting on
[9/23/23, 8:10:55 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah that was my fear as well. I’m glad I man-ed up for once
[9/23/23, 8:12:41 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: To say what I’m feeling

[9/23/23, 8:20:21 PM] Bruno Dumont: Make a similar change my first relashionship made in me
[9/23/23, 8:20:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: It made me realize that it someone cool was interested in me I was in fact interesting
[9/23/23, 8:20:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: And that made me look to my qualities with diferent eyes
[9/23/23, 8:21:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: You’re a person who deserves someone great who can provides what you need
[9/23/23, 8:21:58 PM] Bruno Dumont: So be more confident in yourself
[9/23/23, 8:22:18 PM] Bruno Dumont: But do you want me to keep this a secret or you dont mind?
[9/23/23, 8:31:52 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you for the advice. I hope I can be more self assured as well.
[9/23/23, 8:32:32 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: If they ask, I don’t mind you telling.

[9/30/23, 8:30:33 AM] Bruno Dumont: I'm sorry I'll be more quiet next time
[9/30/23, 8:30:34 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: So I got out of bed, and was about to open the door

[9/30/23, 8:32:09 AM] Bruno Dumont: Today 6 am a group of people decided to come in front on branner

[9/30/23, 8:32:31 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Great first impression
[9/30/23, 8:32:37 AM] Bruno Dumont: luckly I was already awake
[9/30/23, 8:32:59 AM] Bruno Dumont: but I got pretty confused
[9/30/23, 8:33:05 AM] Bruno Dumont: I had a really strange dream
[9/30/23, 8:33:17 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: What happened?
[9/30/23, 8:33:28 AM] Bruno Dumont: I was in the war and then people started throwing grenades at us
[9/30/23, 8:33:47 AM] Bruno Dumont: but the grenades were like bouncy and had a lot of time before they exploded
[9/30/23, 8:33:59 AM] Bruno Dumont: so we had time to kick it out of the range and be safe
[9/30/23, 8:34:29 AM] Bruno Dumont: but it was kinda hard and I remember a lot of people close to me losing their arms and legs to the grenades and I was desperate to kick them far from me
[9/30/23, 8:35:00 AM] Bruno Dumont: and there was a kid who went crazy and tried to kick the grenades in my directions and I tried to kick it back like a hot potato
[9/30/23, 8:35:05 AM] Bruno Dumont: and really creepy
[9/30/23, 8:35:40 AM] Bruno Dumont: I woke up so confused/in fear that I didn't even try to go back to sleep
[9/30/23, 8:38:20 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Huh a stress dream
[9/30/23, 8:38:26 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I hate those
[9/30/23, 8:38:54 AM] Bruno Dumont: In the beginning it wasnt so stressful
[9/30/23, 8:39:13 AM] Bruno Dumont: but when the kid tried to kill me while kicking grenades ay my direction
[9/30/23, 8:39:20 AM] Bruno Dumont: that it started to become more creepy
[9/30/23, 8:40:56 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Do you like to analyze dreams or do you think dreams are just weird brain activity
[9/30/23, 8:41:16 AM] Bruno Dumont: I think they can tell things about you
[9/30/23, 8:41:22 AM] Bruno Dumont: because it was your brain who created it
[9/30/23, 8:41:28 AM] Bruno Dumont: but I don't know how much
[9/30/23, 8:41:38 AM] Bruno Dumont: but what I'm 100% sure
[9/30/23, 8:41:48 AM] Bruno Dumont: it's that they can't be used to see the future
[9/30/23, 8:42:24 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmm, I wonder why you dreamt of another human trying to hurt you then
[9/30/23, 8:42:50 AM] Bruno Dumont: I don't know
[9/30/23, 8:42:58 AM] Bruno Dumont: But the dream I have everytime
[9/30/23, 8:43:08 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a common dream?
[9/30/23, 8:43:17 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s interesting
[9/30/23, 8:43:50 AM] Bruno Dumont: is I dream about the olimpic weak I told you about
[9/30/23, 8:44:06 AM] Bruno Dumont: I think that my brain wants to put a lot of friends from deferent parts of my life in my dream
[9/30/23, 8:44:48 AM] Bruno Dumont: and to become more reasonable he just pick a random place and say that it is the olimpic weak thats why my grandmother my best friend and the guy I know from third grade are all on the same place
[9/30/23, 8:45:47 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Interesting
[9/30/23, 8:45:53 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I never dream of people I know
[9/30/23, 8:45:59 AM] Bruno Dumont: really?
[9/30/23, 8:46:21 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes. I would know the people in my dream, but they don’t exist in reality
[9/30/23, 8:46:32 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Just random ass people my brain crates
[9/30/23, 8:46:53 AM] Bruno Dumont: Stop lying
[9/30/23, 8:46:57 AM] Bruno Dumont: You dreamed about me

[9/30/23, 8:48:50 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s because I talk so much shit about you to everyone
[9/30/23, 8:48:58 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: /j
[9/30/23, 8:49:15 AM] Bruno Dumont: You already said it
[9/30/23, 8:49:26 AM] Bruno Dumont: don't try covering it out
[9/30/23, 8:49:38 AM] Bruno Dumont: It's not working
[9/30/23, 8:50:08 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: You have to respect my beliefs. You are in America
[9/30/23, 8:50:26 AM] Bruno Dumont: You can believe in wtv you want
[9/30/23, 8:50:31 AM] Bruno Dumont: but the truth
[9/30/23, 8:50:39 AM] Bruno Dumont: It can't be changed
[9/30/23, 8:51:52 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: There is no truth, only speculation
[9/30/23, 8:52:28 AM] Bruno Dumont: I don't like reading assigments
[9/30/23, 8:52:33 AM] Bruno Dumont: But I can read you like a book
[9/30/23, 8:52:53 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂 you only read what I want you to read
[9/30/23, 8:52:59 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Have you thought about that
[9/30/23, 8:53:07 AM] Bruno Dumont: Yeah
[9/30/23, 8:53:13 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Uh oh
[9/30/23, 8:53:19 AM] Bruno Dumont: Why the fuck would I read something I don't like
[9/30/23, 8:53:32 AM] Bruno Dumont: I just read what I want to
[9/30/23, 8:54:55 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: good luck on your actual reading though, let me know if you wanna discuss
[9/30/23, 8:56:15 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Not sure if you got my point so I’ll reiterate. I am the author of myself. You might think you can read me, but in reality, you are only reading what I have written for you to see
[9/30/23, 8:56:29 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ooo metaphors
[9/30/23, 8:56:38 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I love metaphors. Beautiful like a puppy
[9/30/23, 8:56:48 AM] Bruno Dumont: I got what you said
[9/30/23, 8:57:27 AM] Bruno Dumont: But you’re half right
[9/30/23, 8:57:41 AM] Bruno Dumont: Because there’s only so much you can hide
[9/30/23, 8:57:54 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah? ૮ ･ ﻌ･ა
[9/30/23, 8:57:57 AM] Bruno Dumont: You can choose the words you write down
[9/30/23, 8:58:15 AM] Bruno Dumont: But there’s so much between the lines that you can’t cover up
[9/30/23, 8:58:25 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Well said
[9/30/23, 8:59:30 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a shame you don’t like the humanities more
[9/30/23, 8:59:39 AM] Bruno Dumont: maybe I like
[9/30/23, 8:59:45 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I think you two would find value in each other
[9/30/23, 8:59:49 AM] Bruno Dumont: but didn't got the chance to experience it
[9/30/23, 8:59:54 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ahh
[9/30/23, 8:59:54 AM] Bruno Dumont: Maybe it's like math
[9/30/23, 9:00:02 AM] Bruno Dumont: I could like more If I see something good
[9/30/23, 9:00:12 AM] Bruno Dumont: but humanities at my school was just so fucking boring
[9/30/23, 9:00:22 AM] Bruno Dumont: memorizing historical facts
[9/30/23, 9:00:47 AM] Bruno Dumont: or in linguistics having to know 47 different rules to write and accent in portuguese
[9/30/23, 9:00:58 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah that doesn’t capture the essence and goal of the humanities
[9/30/23, 9:01:31 AM] Bruno Dumont: neither does math at school covers the essence of math
[9/30/23, 9:01:37 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep
[9/30/23, 9:01:38 AM] Bruno Dumont: that's why highschool sucks
[9/30/23, 9:01:44 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s why I’m so interested in education
[9/30/23, 9:01:48 AM] Bruno Dumont: specially at Brazil
[9/30/23, 9:01:56 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s so important, yet no one in power cares
[9/30/23, 9:02:08 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Because they use it as a tool to do crowd control
[9/30/23, 9:02:37 AM] Bruno Dumont: How would you introduce me to the real point of humanities?
[9/30/23, 9:05:05 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s a very hard questions. (how would you introduce me to the real point of math?) and I’m not a great teacher. However, I would prob start with this book
‎[9/30/23, 9:05:21 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
[9/30/23, 9:05:32 AM] Bruno Dumont: It's already a hard start
[9/30/23, 9:05:33 AM] Bruno Dumont: books
[9/30/23, 9:05:41 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: And have you discuss the short excerpts with a good group of studnegsv
[9/30/23, 9:05:58 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s not a full on book. It’s short excerpts from Greek philosopher
[9/30/23, 9:06:16 AM] Bruno Dumont: discussing seems cool
[9/30/23, 9:06:25 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Very short paragraphs, easy to read
[9/30/23, 9:06:50 AM] Bruno Dumont: Answering your question
[9/30/23, 9:07:02 AM] Bruno Dumont: To introduce you to the real point of math
[9/30/23, 9:07:24 AM] Bruno Dumont: For me math is about patterns recognitions and not about perfoming calculation
[9/30/23, 9:07:44 AM] Bruno Dumont: There's a saying I like that says math is everything else you can't do with a calculator
[9/30/23, 9:08:18 AM] Bruno Dumont: I think someone can only enjoy math when they see clever and creative solutions to problems
[9/30/23, 9:08:19 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmmmm just like how history is not about memorizing historical facts
[9/30/23, 9:08:33 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But they are important to know
[9/30/23, 9:08:51 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I can see your point
[9/30/23, 9:08:54 AM] Bruno Dumont: I think to see why I like math I would introduce to game theory
[9/30/23, 9:09:27 AM] Bruno Dumont: maybe not exactly game theory
[9/30/23, 9:09:32 AM] Bruno Dumont: but math games in general
‎[9/30/23, 9:09:40 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
[9/30/23, 9:10:00 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I saw these the last time I went to the book store
[9/30/23, 9:10:19 AM] Bruno Dumont: I used a poor choice of words
[9/30/23, 9:10:19 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: No idea what game theory is tho
[9/30/23, 9:10:31 AM] Bruno Dumont: game theory is different from what I wanted to say
[9/30/23, 9:10:45 AM] Bruno Dumont: there are some questions about math games and winning strategies
[9/30/23, 9:10:48 AM] Bruno Dumont: for exemple
[9/30/23, 9:12:18 AM] Bruno Dumont: There are 2 piles of rocks both with 20 rocks. 2 players are competing and their goal is to take the last rock of the piles but on every turn you can take how many rocks you want but only from one pile. Which player has a strategie that can guarantee he will win 100% of the time?
[9/30/23, 9:13:36 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Making the other person take a factor of 20
[9/30/23, 9:14:07 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh wait we want the last
[9/30/23, 9:14:12 AM] Bruno Dumont: Let's play the game

[9/30/23, 10:02:36 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s so much easier with 1
[9/30/23, 10:02:49 AM] Bruno Dumont: yeah you just take all of them out and win
[9/30/23, 10:02:53 AM] Bruno Dumont: that's the trivial case
[9/30/23, 10:03:13 AM] Bruno Dumont: now we're playing the easy case that is 2 piles
[9/30/23, 10:03:24 AM] Bruno Dumont: and then you work out the general case with N piles
[9/30/23, 10:03:39 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Does it matter who goes first
[9/30/23, 10:03:45 AM] Bruno Dumont: yeah
[9/30/23, 10:03:58 AM] Bruno Dumont: one of the 2 players can guarantee his victory with one strategy

[9/30/23, 10:05:19 AM] Bruno Dumont: the hint I would say is try playing games and recognizing a pattern
[9/30/23, 10:05:24 AM] Bruno Dumont: play with only 5 rocks on each pile
[9/30/23, 10:05:26 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Nah, I’m gonna give it a try.
[9/30/23, 10:05:29 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok

[9/30/23, 10:14:49 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Is it not always 2 players?
[9/30/23, 10:14:59 AM] Bruno Dumont: player 1 or player 2
[9/30/23, 10:15:03 AM] Bruno Dumont: first or second
[9/30/23, 10:15:13 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ohh, I’m not ready yet, I still have to test it

[10/10/23, 8:51:10 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s a good one
[10/10/23, 8:51:17 PM] Bruno Dumont: Because it’s more broad

kiss/less = vacc

[10/11/23, 3:42:52 PM] Bruno Dumont: so that's why I tought I got confused
[10/11/23, 3:43:39 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: So what’s your Erdos number
[10/11/23, 3:43:57 PM] Bruno Dumont: hmmmmm
[10/11/23, 3:44:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: probably less than u think
[10/11/23, 3:44:08 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: 🙄
[10/11/23, 3:44:12 PM] Bruno Dumont: if we get too loose with the definition
[10/11/23, 3:44:39 PM] Bruno Dumont: because my best friend from highschool had a paper with a guy who is very famous in brazil
[10/11/23, 3:44:43 PM] Bruno Dumont: I bet his number is 2
[10/11/23, 3:45:03 PM] Bruno Dumont: so if you allow me to connect with my friend which we did some basic shit together I could consider myself 4
[10/11/23, 3:45:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: But maybe he is like 3 or 4 as well I dont know

[10/11/23, 5:59:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: Today in class a girl looked at me and said to my face that I’m a bad person
[10/11/23, 6:02:34 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Was she serious or joking?
[10/11/23, 6:03:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: she kinda let it slide
[10/11/23, 6:03:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: She wasnt trying to offend me
[10/11/23, 6:04:00 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol ok then
[10/11/23, 6:04:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: we were discurssing about morality and she was like yeah you believe this but like its because you are a bad person
[10/11/23, 6:04:13 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Interesting thing to say
[10/11/23, 6:04:28 PM] Bruno Dumont: she didnt mean to say it but she did lol
[10/11/23, 6:04:32 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh that’s joking
[10/11/23, 6:04:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'm telling you that she 100% believes I'm a bad person
[10/11/23, 6:04:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: and that she said that by accident
[10/11/23, 6:05:16 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, well she can have her opinion
[10/11/23, 6:05:19 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'm not entirely sure about this but I'm sure she thinks I'm bad lol
[10/11/23, 6:05:35 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Even though I disagree
[10/11/23, 6:05:40 PM] Bruno Dumont: Yup
[10/11/23, 6:05:46 PM] Bruno Dumont: She is just kind of dumb
[10/11/23, 6:05:51 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: 😂
[10/11/23, 6:06:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: she never understand that we are having philosophical conversations
[10/11/23, 6:06:12 PM] Bruno Dumont: and not trying to find solutions to tangible real word problems
[10/11/23, 6:06:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: so she thinks that I saying that it is moral to kill a guy and puts his organs in other people she kind of associates that I would do it
[10/11/23, 6:07:27 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I can understand how you feel
[10/11/23, 6:07:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: but what most probable is that she thinks a good person is a person who does what they think is the right thing and by that definition I'm one of the most moral persons out there because for me what's good is what's good for me and I follow this to the line
[10/11/23, 6:07:41 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But also not everyone is used to philosophical conversation so
[10/11/23, 6:08:27 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha that’s most badly defined logic I’ve ever heard
[10/11/23, 6:08:41 PM] Bruno Dumont: It is very common actually
[10/11/23, 6:09:02 PM] Bruno Dumont: because there's no non-religious way of defining what's objectively good or bad
[10/11/23, 6:09:02 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Maybe she would like Kant and the categorical imperative
[10/11/23, 6:09:10 PM] Bruno Dumont: that's this
[10/11/23, 6:09:31 PM] Bruno Dumont: but I feel like a lot of people I talked to believe more on do what you think is good than the categorical imperative
[10/11/23, 6:09:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't actually agree with the categorical imperative
[10/11/23, 6:10:07 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah it’s a very simplified way of thinking. Not practical
[10/11/23, 6:10:16 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But there is value in it
[10/11/23, 6:12:26 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Your experience reminds me something that happened to me.
[10/11/23, 6:18:03 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ehh long story short, a friend I’m not close with ‘jokingly’ called me “a terrible person” in front of my highschool advisor ‎<This message was edited>

[10/11/23, 6:21:00 PM] Bruno Dumont: well my school was a lot more informal
[10/11/23, 6:21:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: the director of my high school said to me that if I did one math problem every time I jerked off I would have won gold medal in the international competition
[10/11/23, 6:22:04 PM] Bruno Dumont: so I don't think he would mind that joke lol

[10/11/23, 6:23:00 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Your director would be sued so hard if he said that in America
[10/11/23, 6:23:23 PM] Bruno Dumont: but he only says this to some students

[10/15/23, 4:45:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: Hey pretty girl
[10/15/23, 4:45:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: did u take a look at the resume?
[10/15/23, 4:51:43 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, so I have some comments on small things
[10/15/23, 4:52:08 PM] Bruno Dumont: You can talk all the shit you want
[10/15/23, 4:52:19 PM] Bruno Dumont: That's the point on asking for help
[10/15/23, 4:52:32 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: this is a personal preference but I would shorten the description of the accomplishments section. E.g. the first one you say “gold and bronze medalist….3rd out of 6 mil.” I would leave out the 3rd out of 6 mil part, because the size of the number feels weird and you don’t need to include it if you already said gold medalist
[10/15/23, 4:52:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: Dont need to hold back
[10/15/23, 4:53:04 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: If you really want to include it you could use a percentile? Like top 99.9th percentile
[10/15/23, 4:54:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'll keep that in mind
[10/15/23, 4:55:21 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: capitalization: “gold medal” no capitalization. “Brazil National Olympiad” should be capitalized like this
[10/15/23, 4:55:49 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Last thing. The grey coloring on the left is a bit hard to read.
[10/15/23, 4:56:22 PM] Bruno Dumont: This one wont stay
[10/15/23, 4:56:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'll change the layout
[10/15/23, 4:56:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: So don't worry about this
[10/15/23, 4:57:04 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Other than that it looks good to me.  If you want actually helpful advice, you should ask the career centre people 😂
[10/15/23, 4:57:31 PM] Bruno Dumont: I will
[10/15/23, 4:57:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'm asking a lot of people
[10/15/23, 4:57:44 PM] Bruno Dumont: I just want to finish it out first
[10/15/23, 4:58:09 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep. Great start
[10/15/23, 4:59:04 PM] Bruno Dumont: One of the advices I received from this guy from Brazil is that you can get a lot of things done if you just suck it up and ask for help
[10/15/23, 4:59:19 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: HA! Solid advice
[10/15/23, 4:59:29 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn I need to listen to that advice
[10/15/23, 5:00:16 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But my brain would rather me suffer alone than show weakness
[10/15/23, 5:00:40 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Tsk tsk tsk
[10/15/23, 5:01:21 PM] Bruno Dumont: I would rather suffer and succeed than the other way around
[10/15/23, 5:02:10 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I suffer and succeed. But asking for help lessens the suffering
[10/15/23, 5:03:08 PM] Bruno Dumont: Asking for help is suffering
[10/15/23, 5:03:14 PM] Bruno Dumont: but it helps you suceed
[10/15/23, 5:03:29 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah I see what you mean

[10/17/23, 3:05:40 PM] Bruno Dumont: it is so fucking bad I disagree with a lot of what I'm writting
[10/17/23, 3:05:53 PM] Bruno Dumont: but it is different and good enough to show that I at least tried my best
[10/17/23, 3:09:15 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Why don’t you write what you want to say? Is your response based on your readings?

[10/17/23, 3:34:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: yeah
[10/17/23, 3:34:39 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Or maybe just a lazy choice to have gift giving as the way to build relationships
[10/17/23, 3:34:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: but it is totally different game
[10/17/23, 3:34:49 PM] Bruno Dumont: you have little to no talking in the game
[10/17/23, 3:35:01 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Then why build relationships

[10/24/23, 12:38:46 PM] Bruno Dumont: They are cool applications but all the unnecessary hardwork is done for u

[10/24/23, 4:55:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: I just didn't had experience with it
[10/24/23, 4:55:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: so it was full of little mistakes
[10/24/23, 4:55:54 PM] Bruno Dumont: send it
[10/24/23, 4:56:15 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: We had a short debate
[10/24/23, 4:56:44 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: So let’s say a genie tells you your last happy memory…and you experience it at 45 years old
[10/24/23, 4:56:58 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: This means the rest of your life will no longer have happy memories.
[10/24/23, 4:57:08 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: What are you gonna do
[10/24/23, 4:57:29 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't know
[10/24/23, 4:57:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: it depends on how you define it
[10/24/23, 4:57:47 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Define happiness?
[10/24/23, 4:57:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: not having hapiness
[10/24/23, 4:58:10 PM] Bruno Dumont: I will have like overall more sadness but still have happiness or not happiness at all
[10/24/23, 4:58:13 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It means you won’t feel happy. You’ll feel any emotion but happiness
[10/24/23, 4:58:22 PM] Bruno Dumont: it there was no happiness at all I would just kill myself
[10/24/23, 4:58:27 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha me too
[10/24/23, 4:58:39 PM] Bruno Dumont: if I could still be happy but more sad then happy I would try continuing living
[10/24/23, 4:58:42 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But this dude was like imma live my whole life cuz living is cool
[10/24/23, 4:59:08 PM] Bruno Dumont: because I will have a lot of time to be dead after so if I can squeeze out the happiness before dying even if I take a lot of sadness could still be worth it
[10/24/23, 4:59:44 PM] Bruno Dumont: he's just a fucking moron who don't understand how though experiments work
[10/24/23, 4:59:45 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah makes sense
[10/24/23, 5:00:10 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha just because y’all don’t agree doesn’t mean he’s stupid
[10/24/23, 5:00:37 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I just can’t see his logic
[10/24/23, 5:01:15 PM] Bruno Dumont: the argument he gave is idiotic
[10/24/23, 5:01:39 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'm going to live cuz living is cool = I'm going to live cuz it gives me hapiness
[10/24/23, 5:01:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: but we suppose living don't give you hapiness
[10/24/23, 5:02:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: but that's a contradiction that emerges from supposing he had a argument that makes sense
[10/24/23, 5:02:13 PM] Bruno Dumont: so that concludes our proof by contradiction that he is a fucking moron
[10/24/23, 5:05:08 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: In his mind, cool =\= happiness
[10/24/23, 5:05:27 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: He can think existing is cool and miserable at the same time…I think? ‎<This message was edited>

[12/24/23, 5:45:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: I feel like it is

[12/24/23, 5:46:03 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Who knows, I think I’ll need to see a data set
[12/24/23, 5:46:40 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm maybe there’s a cultural taboo for women to ask for sex

[12/29/23, 2:18:31 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: gatinha peixe
[12/29/23, 2:18:43 AM] Bruno Dumont: They can be sinker, floaters, dart or mixed maybe I’m forgetting one
[12/29/23, 2:18:48 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: woah
[12/29/23, 2:18:55 AM] Bruno Dumont: If it is sinker then it wants to drop down more than go up
[12/29/23, 2:19:11 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: well the two i met were darters
[12/29/23, 2:19:25 AM] Bruno Dumont: So you should keep in on the top of the green bar so when it drop down you can catch it more easily
[12/29/23, 2:19:36 AM] Bruno Dumont: All of the super hard fish are mixed
[12/29/23, 2:19:50 AM] Bruno Dumont: But if it is really hard you can buy a better fishing rod
[12/29/23, 2:19:52 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: fuck i just lost another one 😫
[12/29/23, 2:20:11 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: it's actually impossible
[12/29/23, 2:20:13 AM] Bruno Dumont: Better rods allow you to put bait so you can catch more fish
[12/29/23, 2:20:45 AM] Bruno Dumont: And buy a modifier willy sells one that makes the progress bar fall more slowly when the fish get out
[12/29/23, 2:20:50 AM] Bruno Dumont: It is the perfect for this moment
[12/29/23, 2:21:10 AM] Bruno Dumont: It is well worth the investment to buy the iridium rod if you have the money
[12/29/23, 2:21:14 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: ok i def need that..cuz i just lost another one

[12/29/23, 4:07:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: During 9 months I’m gonna make my number 1 priority to learn everything there is to know about parenting
[12/29/23, 4:07:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: Then I’m gonna come up with a plan
[12/29/23, 4:08:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: I’m gonna have specialist to help me
[12/29/23, 4:08:16 PM] Bruno Dumont: Take feedback
[12/29/23, 4:08:18 PM] Bruno Dumont: And improve
[12/29/23, 4:08:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: I’m going to go to a psychologist just to talk about parenting
[12/29/23, 4:09:21 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Well if I ever have a kid, my goal would be to train them with the skills to self-regulate themselves into an intelligent and empathetic person
[12/29/23, 4:09:33 PM] Bruno Dumont: Yup
[12/29/23, 4:09:35 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Both to themselves and other people
[12/29/23, 4:09:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: I think that’s the meta
[12/29/23, 4:09:56 PM] Bruno Dumont: Cause it’s impossible to ser everything they are doing
[12/29/23, 4:10:08 PM] Bruno Dumont: So the only viable option is to trust them
[12/29/23, 4:10:24 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: yeah
[12/29/23, 4:10:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: So you need to make him smart and mature

[12/29/23, 4:10:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: But I wanna shortcut him
[12/29/23, 4:10:56 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahha
[12/29/23, 4:11:05 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don’t want him going through the hastle of learning financial education
[12/29/23, 4:11:15 PM] Bruno Dumont: I’m gonna implant this through his childhood
[12/29/23, 4:11:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don’t want him having to learn the importance of exercise I want to make it as natural to him as taking a shower
[12/29/23, 4:11:57 PM] Bruno Dumont: Everything that I feel is valuable I want to make him learn it effortlessly
[12/29/23, 4:12:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: So he can focus his energy in the future in whatever he wants to do
[12/29/23, 4:12:58 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Won’t be easy though, have you ever tried convincing your parents to pick up a habit? I imagine that’s how working with a kid would be, if not worse ‎<This message was edited>
[12/29/23, 4:13:26 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Lol anyways, parenting is hardddd. That’s why so many fuck it up so bad ‎<This message was edited>

[12/29/23, 4:13:58 PM] Bruno Dumont: If I want him to workout I’m gonna workout since he’s 1 year old
[12/29/23, 4:14:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: Take him with me
[12/29/23, 4:14:05 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah but it’s the translation process that’s the challenge
[12/29/23, 4:14:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: And he’s gonna see this as natural
[12/29/23, 4:14:21 PM] Bruno Dumont: I’m not saying it’s easy
[12/29/23, 4:14:25 PM] Bruno Dumont: That’s just the plan
[12/29/23, 4:14:39 PM] Bruno Dumont: But you create the plan to throw it all away
[12/29/23, 4:14:44 PM] Bruno Dumont: And create a new one
[12/29/23, 4:14:51 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: thats a good mindset
[12/29/23, 4:14:58 PM] Bruno Dumont: But the fact of the matter is that I’m gonna give it my alk

[12/30/23, 4:15:14 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I forget that not everyone is observant
[12/30/23, 4:15:54 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I showed him how i do inclined bench, and he kept holding the weights vertically
[12/30/23, 4:16:27 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I showed him 20lb first, and then he did 25lb
[12/30/23, 4:16:49 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I also do 25lb. but he was like no it's too heavy for you

[12/30/23, 4:21:10 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: intersting line of questioning don't you think

[12/30/23, 4:23:05 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: hehe, I did mention that to him because he wanted to lose weight
[12/30/23, 4:23:46 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: but idk, cardio is more familiar to him, and it's hard to get him to try new things
[12/30/23, 4:24:43 AM] Bruno Dumont: Yup

[12/31/23, 2:11:22 AM] Bruno Dumont: If you measure the intensity and frequency of their light through a full “year” aka a full rotation of both

[1/5/24, 3:53:10 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s pretty basic advice like just try to interview as much as you can, even if you don’t want the job, so you can get a hang of what questions they ask…how to tell a story productively…

[1/21/24, 5:58:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: I would guess it has something to do like seeing the color of the pixel
[1/21/24, 5:58:21 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: The code is also taking out all the black (like my hair) because I’m  only keeping pixels that do not have blue over a certain value ‎<This message was edited>

[1/21/24, 6:00:43 PM] Bruno Dumont: If it doesn’t work change it
[1/21/24, 6:01:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: Try 10, 50, 100, 150 and stuff in between

[1/25/24, 11:26:29 AM] Bruno Dumont: Math is a language
[1/25/24, 11:26:39 AM] Bruno Dumont: So there’s no equation in English

[1/25/24, 11:31:33 AM] Bruno Dumont: I wonder if there’s correlation
[1/25/24, 11:31:44 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it’s my lack of…comprehension?

[1/26/24, 2:35:22 PM] Bruno Dumont: What do you think about this?
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2gB0KmvhFP/?igsh=MTRhZmU1ODE2NA==
[1/26/24, 4:01:55 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it’s depends on the age group.
[1/26/24, 4:03:34 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: For example, if you have a stable life at 30, 2 years is an acceptable time to consider marriage. But if you are younger, more time wouldn’t hurt
[1/26/24, 4:03:57 PM] Bruno Dumont: yeah acceptable
[1/26/24, 4:04:03 PM] Bruno Dumont: but what do you think is the optimal
[1/26/24, 4:04:06 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: What are your thoughts
[1/26/24, 4:04:24 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Can you specify what you mean by optimal?
[1/26/24, 4:05:06 PM] Bruno Dumont: suppose on the x axis is the time spend dating and on the y axiss is the expected happiness of the mariage
[1/26/24, 4:05:17 PM] Bruno Dumont: find the max of f(x) over the real numbers
[1/26/24, 4:05:30 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Woah, that makes it very clear
[1/26/24, 4:05:34 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
[1/26/24, 4:05:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: you may assume the function is continous
[1/26/24, 4:05:39 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahah
[1/26/24, 4:06:35 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Man this is complicated, I don’t think a general solution is going to work for this function
[1/26/24, 4:08:29 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But if I had to throw out a number based on feeling, I would say ~4
[1/26/24, 4:08:41 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: You?
[1/26/24, 4:08:41 PM] Bruno Dumont: where's your calculations
[1/26/24, 4:08:43 PM] Bruno Dumont: ?
[1/26/24, 4:08:59 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: That answer is based on feeling
[1/26/24, 4:09:04 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: No calculations
[1/26/24, 4:09:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: We need to find the maximum over the manifold denifed by the living age
[1/26/24, 4:09:29 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: 🤯
[1/26/24, 4:09:31 PM] Bruno Dumont: since the living age is bounded and closed we know we are working on a compact set
[1/26/24, 4:09:45 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Uhhuh
[1/26/24, 4:09:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: on a compact set all critical points can be found using the lagrange multiplier
[1/26/24, 4:10:05 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Btw, I cannot figure out my cs pset bunbun. I need your help please ‎<This message was edited>
[1/26/24, 4:10:10 PM] Bruno Dumont: with the critical points we need to see if they are local maxima, local minima or settle points
[1/26/24, 4:10:32 PM] Bruno Dumont: but since we are on a compact set every continuous function achives a global maxima and minima over the set
[1/26/24, 4:10:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: hence we just need to compare the critical points and get the higher one
[1/26/24, 4:10:49 PM] Bruno Dumont: and that concludes our proof
[1/26/24, 4:11:02 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Wow
[1/26/24, 4:12:19 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2VCwGjuJDy/?igsh=MWQ1ZGUxMzBkMA==

[3/14/24, 3:04:37 PM] Bruno Dumont: I do believe that you don’t love unconditionally
[3/14/24, 3:04:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: But that is what I want
[3/14/24, 3:04:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: It makes no sense for you to do so
[3/14/24, 3:05:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: You love me the way you need to
[3/14/24, 3:05:23 PM] Bruno Dumont: More than that and it would be unhealthy and borderline obsessive if you loved me completely unconditionally

[3/14/24, 3:13:29 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'm translating to you
[3/14/24, 3:13:56 PM] Bruno Dumont: Hi Bruno,

Since you didn't call me, I decided to send a message. You have given me countless joys and some sorrows too, but sadness, humiliation, and contempt like this last one, I thought I would never experience! Honestly, I thought I didn't deserve it because I did everything with a lot of love. But rest assured that I have learned. I have learned that you are far superior to me, that you don't need any help. I promise never to try to help you again! I just want to tell you one last thing: Frederico is where he is because he has a lot of intelligence, along with education, charisma, and love for the family!

my grandma sent me this
[3/14/24, 3:14:05 PM] Bruno Dumont: cause she said she would help me with some interships
[3/14/24, 3:14:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: and I didn't respond to her

[3/15/24, 10:19:50 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I found out the reason why when you add floats in python, it gives a slightly off value
[3/15/24, 11:03:13 AM] Bruno Dumont: why?
[3/15/24, 11:47:16 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Because computers store the floats as binary, which gets truncated if it’s too long ‎<This message was edited>
[3/15/24, 11:48:36 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: and so, the error happens during the conversion between base 2 and base 10: it uses the truncated binary representation to do calculations, and then coverts the result to base 10 ‎<This message was edited>
[3/15/24, 11:52:05 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: We used Taylor series to do the conversion, so freaking cool

[3/24/24, 8:32:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: But not a best friend
[3/24/24, 8:33:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: I’d rather be more polarizing
[3/24/24, 8:34:00 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah people pleasing is the other extreme. I think it’s important to keep a balance in mind

[3/24/24, 8:38:19 PM] Bruno Dumont: To not be too pleasing everyone you should be a little polarizing
[3/24/24, 8:38:37 PM] Bruno Dumont: Don’t be scared to express your opinions so you can find people who like what you actually are
[3/24/24, 8:39:07 PM] Bruno Dumont: Like how I wasn’t scared to tell you my selfish life philosophy when we were meeting
[3/24/24, 8:39:12 PM] Bruno Dumont: And you still liked me
[3/24/24, 8:39:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: But if didn’t
[3/24/24, 8:39:34 PM] Bruno Dumont: I would have just saved myself

[3/30/24, 9:21:11 AM] Bruno Dumont: But we’ll do it eventually
[3/30/24, 9:23:35 AM] Bruno Dumont: I had a very interesting linguistics discussion today with my father
[3/30/24, 9:23:41 AM] Bruno Dumont: I wanted your perspective on it
[3/30/24, 9:31:01 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Tell me about it
[3/30/24, 9:34:21 AM] Bruno Dumont: Basic we were discussing if you have a line (a queue) is the end of the line the person who just got in the line or the person waiting the longest
[3/30/24, 9:34:30 AM] Bruno Dumont: I’m on the person who just got in team
[3/30/24, 9:34:35 AM] Bruno Dumont: And my father on the other team
[3/30/24, 9:35:39 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Same, it’s like saying hey where is the end of the snake. You would point to it’s tail
[3/30/24, 9:36:00 AM] Bruno Dumont: It’s because we think of the line as en entity
[3/30/24, 9:36:09 AM] Bruno Dumont: But he thinks of it as an experience
[3/30/24, 9:36:22 AM] Bruno Dumont: So the beginning of the line experience is when you get in the line
[3/30/24, 9:36:30 AM] Bruno Dumont: And the end is when you finish waiting
[3/30/24, 9:36:47 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh I see, he is looking at it from a-person-in-the-line perspective
[3/30/24, 9:37:08 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: And I see it as a person outside the line
[3/30/24, 9:38:03 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Interesting!
[3/30/24, 9:38:18 AM] Bruno Dumont: Yeah
[3/30/24, 9:38:23 AM] Bruno Dumont: I knew you’d like it
[3/30/24, 9:45:08 AM] Bruno Dumont: Wonder if that changes in different languages
[3/30/24, 9:45:28 AM] Bruno Dumont: But is funny how my father was so worried about being right or wrong
[3/30/24, 9:45:45 AM] Bruno Dumont: I couldn’t give him this insight about the different perspectives
[3/30/24, 9:46:35 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Maybe! I think you’ve seen that reel about how different languages think of time as moving in different directions?
[3/30/24, 9:46:44 AM] Bruno Dumont: Yup

[4/23/24, 1:10:16 PM] Bruno Dumont: You helped me so much
[4/23/24, 1:10:21 PM] Bruno Dumont: Sleep is part of everyone's life. A person spends an average of 1/3 of their life sleeping, but despite this, not everyone pays due attention to sleep. According to a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention one-third of American adults are sleep-deprived. The situation is even worse between college students, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 91% of all teens fail to get that amount of sleep on a consistent basis.In the midst of this silent sleep deprivation epidemic the UC Berkeley professor of neuroscience and sleep researcher Matt Walker gives a talk about the importance of sleep and health problems associated with sleep deprivation. In “Sleep Is Your Superpower” Matt uses analogies, emotional diction and statistics from a number of different researches to effectively convince the audience that sleep is extremely important for all aspects of wellness. 

Most people know that sleeping is important but few understand how deep the connection between sleep and health is. In his talk the speaker uses analogies to efficiently express the extreme importance of sleep in health. He uses a powerful analogie on the title of his video “sleep is your superpower” and he wraps up the talk with another comparison in “...[sleep] it is mother nature’s best effort yet at immortality”. In his first analogy the author wishes to establish the importance of sleep in a short and effective way. The title of a youtube video is usually small and eye-catching user’s spend only a few seconds deciding if they should watch a video or not and so it is crucial for the author to express his main argument in a small sentence that makes the viewer intrigued to understand more. The audience engages with sleep daily and hence view it as a natural and common thing but on this analogy the professor Walker compares sleep to a superpower, a power that is beyond nature and can elevate you beyond the status of a normal human. This connection sparks an interest in the potential viewers to want to find out what is so special about sleep that would make a habit every person does daily to be considered a superpower. On his second analogy at the end of the talk he has already presented a number of arguments as to why sleep is important and at this point the audience is already familiar with this idea so his analogy serves to demonstrate the degree at which he considers sleep to be beneficial for your health. The author does not compare sleep with mother nature's best tool for longevity but instead as mother nature's best shot at immortality. This evidence he believes sleep is not simply important to your longevity but it is the closest one can get to being immortal is the most effective method of extending your life time. So with the analogies rather than simply listing benefits of sleep he provides the audience with a concrete and memorable measure of how important sleep is.

[4/30/24, 4:02:18 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Bunbun, Do you remember much about Lagrange multipliers? ‎<This message was edited>
[4/30/24, 4:02:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: Maybe
[4/30/24, 4:02:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: We didn't call it like that
[4/30/24, 4:02:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: but I think I know
[4/30/24, 4:02:47 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Im stuck on a sorta theoretic question
[4/30/24, 4:02:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: send me
[4/30/24, 4:03:05 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Okie! Thanks bunbun
‎[4/30/24, 4:03:47 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
‎[4/30/24, 4:04:10 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎image omitted
[4/30/24, 4:04:43 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I can easily find a point on F (that’s also on the surface) that has a bigger value
[4/30/24, 4:05:06 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But idk why it implies that f has no global extrema then
[4/30/24, 4:05:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: it is a simple argument
[4/30/24, 4:05:46 PM] Bruno Dumont: that goes as follow
[4/30/24, 4:07:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: 1) all local maximum are critical points
2) all of the critical points are those two you found
3) there is a point bigger than those two points you found
2 + 3) there is a point bigger than all critical points 
if a critical point exists we would have 
1 + 2 + 3) there is a point bigger than the maximum --> contradiction
[4/30/24, 4:12:32 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok, so what are the points that I found?
[4/30/24, 4:12:49 PM] Bruno Dumont: those two
[4/30/24, 4:13:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2), 0) and (-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 0)
[4/30/24, 4:13:18 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: They must be critical points no?
[4/30/24, 4:13:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: but the lagrange multiplier is a method to find critical points
[4/30/24, 4:14:15 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes, so I guess I found some local extremas then?
[4/30/24, 4:14:22 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Im not sure how to explain it
[4/30/24, 4:14:32 PM] Bruno Dumont: the lagrange multiplier is like a detector of all critical points of a function subjected to a manifold (a manifold is just a name given to a part of space like this hyperparabola)
[4/30/24, 4:14:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: you used the lagrange multipler and found those two critical points
[4/30/24, 4:15:05 PM] Bruno Dumont: since the maximum is always a critical point the maximum if exists must be one of the two
[4/30/24, 4:15:24 PM] Bruno Dumont: but look there is a point bigger than both so no way a maximum could exist
[4/30/24, 4:15:27 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh and the maximum doesn’t exist
[4/30/24, 4:15:30 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I see!
[4/30/24, 4:15:49 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Wait
[4/30/24, 4:16:00 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But the minimum also doesn’t exist
[4/30/24, 4:16:12 PM] Bruno Dumont: can u find a point smaller than both?
[4/30/24, 4:16:16 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes
[4/30/24, 4:16:28 PM] Bruno Dumont: then it doesn't
[4/30/24, 4:16:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: maybe there are only saddle points
[4/30/24, 4:17:01 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok I see!
[4/30/24, 4:17:14 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you bunbun

[5/7/24, 1:25:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: and it worked
[5/7/24, 1:25:53 PM] Bruno Dumont: 79/82

[5/15/24, 11:03:06 AM] Bruno Dumont: what do you think I should do
[5/15/24, 11:03:16 AM] Bruno Dumont: don't tell this to anyone
[5/15/24, 11:06:02 AM] Bruno Dumont: but I was talking with ellen today and she seemed quite upset. I talked with her and apparently Pietro lied to her about dating someone else during the fall quarter (he explicitly said he didn't but she found out he did). So remember I told you I heard about him cheating on his ex? She asked me if I heard anything bad about it and I quite didn't tell her this because I don't know if it is true. Should I just tell her I heard this or not? Cause I don't want to tell her something that is potentially false and create distrust in their relationship but I also think she might deserve to know. What do you think I should do. 
PS: I love you so much I'm so excited to fuck you tonight
[5/15/24, 12:02:54 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I feel bad that Ellen has to go through this
[5/15/24, 12:03:01 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I think if she specifically wants to know about his last relationship, you could direct her to ask the person you heard it and from
[5/15/24, 12:03:46 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Like “I think xxx knows more about this”
[5/15/24, 12:04:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: I heard it from Sally
[5/15/24, 12:04:07 PM] Bruno Dumont: but she heard from someone else
[5/15/24, 12:04:14 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I personally wouldn’t deliver such second-hand information
[5/15/24, 12:04:15 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't think sally knows a lot about it
[5/15/24, 12:04:47 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But more importantly, bunbun I love you so much too
[5/15/24, 12:04:59 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: And I’m horny for you (as always)
[5/15/24, 12:05:00 PM] Bruno Dumont: Much more importantly

[5/31/24, 10:10:58 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah but that’s not the focus. You accused (sorry for the word choice) me of not telling you again
[5/31/24, 10:11:14 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: when no plan was made in the first place ‎<This message was edited>
[5/31/24, 10:11:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: You gave me verbal confirmation
[5/31/24, 10:11:29 PM] Bruno Dumont: More than once
[5/31/24, 10:11:34 PM] Bruno Dumont: That you wanted to sleep over
[5/31/24, 10:11:48 PM] Bruno Dumont: One of this times 5 minutes before
[5/31/24, 10:11:52 PM] Bruno Dumont: You cancel it
[5/31/24, 10:13:22 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: We are talking about different points. I admit that cancelling last minute was my mistake. But I am also saying that you accuse me of not communicating with you, when you also made the assumption that I would sleep over when you never asked me
[5/31/24, 10:13:35 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But I don’t think this is productive to talk about anymore

[6/3/24, 3:38:21 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Well now I want to read her essay
[6/3/24, 3:38:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: bullshit
[6/3/24, 3:38:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: not a good essay
[6/3/24, 3:38:34 PM] Bruno Dumont: is wellwritten
[6/3/24, 3:38:39 PM] Bruno Dumont: but the arguments are kinda mid
[6/3/24, 3:38:53 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm hmm
[6/3/24, 3:38:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: I came up with a better argument for her
[6/3/24, 3:39:03 PM] Bruno Dumont: than all the ones she had
[6/3/24, 3:39:15 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh nice! What did you come up with
[6/3/24, 3:39:32 PM] Bruno Dumont: In one point of her essay
[6/3/24, 3:39:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: she comments on negative bias
[6/3/24, 3:39:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: that the human brain pays more attention to negative experiences
[6/3/24, 3:39:49 PM] Bruno Dumont: than positive
[6/3/24, 3:39:56 PM] Bruno Dumont: and I told her I would argue as follows
[6/3/24, 3:41:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: The human brain is wired to pay attention to novel experiences. If something happens a lot your brain gets use to it and it is not seen as something worth remembering. That means that pretty persons don't pay attention to good experiences related to their beauty such as compliments. However, bad experiences hit much harder cause they are not used to it
[6/3/24, 3:41:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: This explains why if you compliment a pretty girl that is insecure she won't mind much but if someone says something bad that might be very harmful
[6/3/24, 3:41:56 PM] Bruno Dumont: is one of the argument that makes more sense with the previous one
[6/3/24, 3:42:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: but I though it was cool
[6/3/24, 3:42:15 PM] Bruno Dumont: I can send u her entire essay if you want to read it lol
[6/3/24, 3:42:57 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm, but if someone is insecure about their appearance, wouldn’t being called pretty be the novel experience instead?
[6/3/24, 3:43:14 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I still remember when you told me you thought I was pretty, and it being shocking to me ‎<This message was edited>
[6/3/24, 3:44:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: No because they are insecure
[6/3/24, 3:44:27 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah maybe like the human brain likes to hear thing that affirm beliefs it already has
[6/3/24, 3:44:28 PM] Bruno Dumont: but hot as fuck
[6/3/24, 3:44:37 PM] Bruno Dumont: that is the point
[6/3/24, 3:44:41 PM] Bruno Dumont: just like you
[6/3/24, 3:44:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: smoaking hot
[6/3/24, 3:44:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: like a Greek goddess
[6/3/24, 3:44:53 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hahaha thank you
[6/3/24, 3:44:54 PM] Bruno Dumont: descending upon humanity
[6/3/24, 3:45:03 PM] Bruno Dumont: with the aura that drives a men insane
[6/3/24, 3:45:05 PM] Bruno Dumont: with a mere look
[6/3/24, 3:45:12 PM] Bruno Dumont: a scent so powerful
‎[6/3/24, 3:45:16 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: ‎sticker omitted
[6/3/24, 3:45:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: capable of hooking any living creature in a 500 feet radius
[6/3/24, 3:45:49 PM] Bruno Dumont: and looks that can even blind
[6/3/24, 3:45:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: like you
[6/3/24, 3:46:02 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: hooking 😂, am I nautilus
[6/3/24, 3:46:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: how do you know this
[6/3/24, 3:46:18 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: You played him I think
[6/3/24, 3:46:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: He is my main
[6/3/24, 3:46:35 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yep, the big guy
[6/3/24, 3:46:40 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: hook and smash
[6/3/24, 4:21:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: The biggest question I am left with by the end of your RBA is "okay I understand the importance of sleep, but how can I improve my sleep?" 

I think at the end of the essay, either in the conclusion as a "call to action" or by giving it its own sub-section, you can expand on steps the reader can take to improve their sleep. 

For example, you mentioned the importance of sleep quality over sleep quantity. But how can one improve sleep quality? Does it involve removing distractions? Are there any studies done on what sleeping conditions yields the best quality of sleep?

Similarly, you mentioned earlier that those who sleep more than 8 hours and those who sleep less than 7 hours are both at an increased risk of mortality. So what is the optimal duration of sleep? Does it differ from person to person? 

These are all questions that you can consider expanding on
[6/3/24, 4:22:00 PM] Bruno Dumont: whats your opinion on this feedback I received?
[6/3/24, 5:15:28 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah it’s something you can address. Maybe connecting with the section about quality over quantity, you can include some factual tips. ‎<This message was edited>
[6/3/24, 5:15:41 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t think it’s necessary though, because your focus is about telling people the way we are thinking about sleep is wrong
[6/3/24, 5:15:56 PM] Bruno Dumont: I need more words
[6/3/24, 5:15:58 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: How to sleep is a lesser focus
[6/3/24, 5:16:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: I need to yap
[6/3/24, 5:16:13 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: However, if she has this feeling, that means we have made out point unclear
[6/3/24, 5:16:33 PM] Bruno Dumont: really?
[6/3/24, 5:16:33 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Then you can add it and we can see how it feels
[6/3/24, 5:16:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: I think its a very natural question
[6/3/24, 5:16:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: if the text is efficient
[6/3/24, 5:17:02 PM] Bruno Dumont: then you should understand sleep as important
[6/3/24, 5:17:05 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes that is possible as well
[6/3/24, 5:17:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: and this prompt you to want to sleep better

[6/5/24, 10:31:47 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I will just imagine a reality where you grabbed one for me
[6/5/24, 12:29:19 PM] Bruno Dumont: Relationship Agreement
Proposal 1: Since you like walking we need schedule walking time for us. We need to walk together for at least 4 days a week. We will walk for something close to 30 minutes and talk on the way. I will be allowed to listen to music but I will only use one side to listen to you. Additionally, walking needs to be at a reasonable speed maybe even running so that it can be a source of exercise for us. If any days we are tired and don't want to walk it can be switched to chilling at an outside place but we need to walk at least 2 days a week. 

Proposal 2: Every month we need to go on a date out of campus just the two of us. The dates need to include something fun for both of us and it needs to be something special to get us out of the routine. 

Proposal 3: Every week we need to spend at least two hours doing something together. We can either play a game the two of us do some type of sport (not counting gym or walking) or do anything that is engaging. This would be something that I would enjoy and might create cool moments for us

I expect you to carefully analyze the proposals above and give a revised agreement. You can add, remove, or edit anything and we should try to follow them. We can think about these things like our gym and suits time. Is an agreement we have that does not need to be 100% enforced all the time but we make a conscious effort to make it consistent. 

This agreement has been made in the effort to work on our relationship transforming it into something enjoyable for both of us. I really love you and I want you to know this. (Btw this is a plan so toma gap I can make plans)
[6/5/24, 1:43:34 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww bunbun this is very very sweet of you
[6/5/24, 1:43:45 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Thank you for coming up with these proposals for us

Proposal 2: Every month we need to go on a date out of campus just the two of us. The dates need to include something fun for both of us and it needs to be something special to get us out of the routine. [We can 1. Rotate who plans the date every month or 2. Plan it together]

Proposal 3: Every week or so we need to spend at least two hours doing something together. We can either play a game the two of us do some type of sport (not counting gym or walking) or do anything that is engaging. This would be something that I would enjoy and might create cool moments for us

[6/30/24, 2:06:57 PM] Bruno Dumont: My only fear was not being attractive to girls
[6/30/24, 2:07:05 PM] Bruno Dumont: But once I got over that it got better
[6/30/24, 2:07:12 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don’t know what makes you scared

[6/30/24, 2:12:10 PM] Bruno Dumont: To me it was “I don’t look good enough because girls don’t find me attractive”
[6/30/24, 2:12:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: And I proved to myself that there are always people that like how you look

[8/11/24, 5:02:41 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But I have trouble with emotional permanence. It’s a little dumb, but you know how babies don’t have object permanence?
[8/11/24, 5:03:02 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Well I’m still learning emotional permanence, and it’s definitely getting better

[8/11/24, 5:04:25 PM] Bruno Dumont: Elaborate
[8/11/24, 5:04:37 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: And it makes everything more bareable
[8/11/24, 5:05:52 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s just sometimes I’m upset about some small thing. Then you hit me with joke, and I laugh, and my appreciation for you puts my life into perspective
[8/11/24, 5:06:08 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: That I shouldn’t waste my emotions on smalls things

[8/11/24, 5:06:41 PM] Bruno Dumont: That’s hard to find
[8/11/24, 5:06:52 PM] Bruno Dumont: But I do it in a way to make it lighter
[8/11/24, 5:06:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: And more bearable
[8/11/24, 5:07:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: It’s just my emotional reaction

[8/11/24, 5:09:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: We worked on it
[8/11/24, 5:09:16 PM] Bruno Dumont: Remember the beginning?
[8/11/24, 5:09:20 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: We did

[8/11/24, 5:11:04 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I like to think that we have the type of love that you see in fancy poetry
[8/11/24, 5:11:05 PM] Bruno Dumont: Love is indeed quite beautiful
[8/11/24, 5:11:15 PM] Bruno Dumont: Yup
[8/11/24, 5:11:36 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Off topic, but my glutes have such a pump

[8/11/24, 5:11:51 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Wish you were here to feel
[8/11/24, 5:11:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: But seeing as how the purpose of life is hapiness

[8/11/24, 5:12:46 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Very true

[8/11/24, 5:15:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: But I wanted to point out
[8/11/24, 5:15:46 PM] Bruno Dumont: I did in fact pay attention to your glute pump
[8/11/24, 5:15:56 PM] Bruno Dumont: And I reciprocate the feeling of wanting to feel it
[8/11/24, 5:16:00 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh yeah?

[8/11/24, 5:18:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: But I love you regardless of it
[8/11/24, 5:18:26 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m realizing that eating cookies and icecream isn’t bad
[8/11/24, 5:18:38 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: As long as I’m not binging and still eating nutritiously
[8/11/24, 5:18:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: Yup
[8/11/24, 5:18:52 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It actually stops my binges
[8/11/24, 5:18:54 PM] Bruno Dumont: We can work on a good diet together
[8/11/24, 5:19:04 PM] Bruno Dumont: But restrictions are never the right move
[8/11/24, 5:19:09 PM] Bruno Dumont: And starving as well
[8/11/24, 5:19:19 PM] Bruno Dumont: That’s why cheat meals exist
[8/11/24, 5:19:23 PM] Bruno Dumont: To control cravings
[8/11/24, 5:19:33 PM] Bruno Dumont: And cause it’s fire
[8/11/24, 5:19:40 PM] Bruno Dumont: Eating is fire (for some people)
[8/11/24, 5:19:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: So you shouldn’t stop yourself from eating what u love
[8/11/24, 5:19:50 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Man I’m still thinking bout the pistachio gelato I had the other day
[8/11/24, 5:20:06 PM] Bruno Dumont: Just do it in a way that allows you to keep doing it for years to come
[8/11/24, 5:20:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: While being healthy
[8/11/24, 5:20:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: You can diet to keep the ability to eat cookies untill ur okd
[8/11/24, 5:21:04 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m honestly not even restricting
[8/11/24, 5:21:07 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I think
[8/11/24, 5:21:23 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I just don’t feel as hungry anymore after the first few weeks
[8/11/24, 5:21:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: Babe
[8/11/24, 5:21:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: I have to tell u
[8/11/24, 5:21:40 PM] Bruno Dumont: Bout my grandma
[8/11/24, 5:22:07 PM] Bruno Dumont: the reason we spent so much time in my grandam
[8/11/24, 5:22:17 PM] Bruno Dumont: when we were supposed to only stay for a few minutes
[8/11/24, 5:22:24 PM] Bruno Dumont: its because she dislocated her sholder
[8/11/24, 5:22:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: while laying down
[8/11/24, 5:22:40 PM] Bruno Dumont: and I looked at her
[8/11/24, 5:22:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: her entire arm was bruised purple from start to finish
[8/11/24, 5:22:58 PM] Bruno Dumont: from falling down
[8/11/24, 5:23:04 PM] Bruno Dumont: she can't walk without help
[8/11/24, 5:23:22 PM] Bruno Dumont: and my dad was scolding her for walking around the house when she should just lay down cause she can fall at any point
[8/11/24, 5:23:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: note she is not even 80 yet
[8/11/24, 5:23:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: its just a matter of time till she passes away
[8/11/24, 5:23:58 PM] Bruno Dumont: she can't do anything except lay down in bed
[8/11/24, 5:24:04 PM] Bruno Dumont: and that is not good for the brain
[8/11/24, 5:24:14 PM] Bruno Dumont: it just really made me realize the importance of working out
[8/11/24, 5:24:21 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m so sorry to hear that bunbun
[8/11/24, 5:24:21 PM] Bruno Dumont: we will have all the tools to live a long life
[8/11/24, 5:24:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: but we need to take care of our bodies to be able to walk and have freedom
[8/11/24, 5:25:03 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah, I want to have a life with quality
[8/11/24, 5:25:06 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't feel that bad is just natural she is getting old its a part of life
[8/11/24, 5:25:11 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: And to be with bunbun as well
[8/11/24, 5:25:13 PM] Bruno Dumont: but we have the option to not go though this
[8/11/24, 5:25:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: my favorite grandma is almost that age but she is night and day difference
[8/11/24, 5:25:44 PM] Bruno Dumont: she can clean the house by herself go pick up my cousins from school
[8/11/24, 5:25:46 PM] Bruno Dumont: travel with us
[8/11/24, 5:25:56 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m happy for her
[8/11/24, 5:26:04 PM] Bruno Dumont: and she doesn't even do gym she does a resistance training in the pool that's kinda strange
[8/11/24, 5:26:07 PM] Bruno Dumont: but its working
[8/11/24, 5:26:17 PM] Bruno Dumont: I want us to be like my favorite grandma
[8/11/24, 5:26:18 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Resistente in the pool?
[8/11/24, 5:26:30 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Is it for less stress on joints?
[8/11/24, 5:26:40 PM] Bruno Dumont: and cause she likes pool lol
[8/11/24, 5:26:57 PM] Bruno Dumont: unfortunately my grandpa
[8/11/24, 5:27:03 PM] Bruno Dumont: was very different
[8/11/24, 5:27:08 PM] Bruno Dumont: he smoked for a big part of his life
[8/11/24, 5:27:15 PM] Bruno Dumont: and he was obese and a heavy drinker
[8/11/24, 5:27:20 PM] Bruno Dumont: so he didn't survive covid
[8/11/24, 5:27:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: maybe if he also took care of his health he would be here to be proud of my Chinese girl
[8/11/24, 5:27:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: he would absolutely love you
[8/11/24, 5:27:57 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Aww, I think I would’ve liked him as well
[8/11/24, 5:27:58 PM] Bruno Dumont: cheese, birdwatching, language learning, china he would be obsessed over you
[8/11/24, 5:28:08 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: He sounds like a very interesting person, with lots of stories
[8/11/24, 5:28:14 PM] Bruno Dumont: he was
[8/11/24, 5:28:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: I think there was so much I could have leaned from him if I had a couple more years
[8/11/24, 5:28:53 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s a heavy feeling I feel like
[8/11/24, 5:28:53 PM] Bruno Dumont: but that's wishful thinking
[8/11/24, 5:28:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't regret it much
[8/11/24, 5:29:06 PM] Bruno Dumont: I have only one regret towards him
[8/11/24, 5:29:16 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah?
[8/11/24, 5:29:22 PM] Bruno Dumont: a few months before dying
[8/11/24, 5:29:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: he told me he felt like I only loved my mom
[8/11/24, 5:29:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: I just think he didn't understand
[8/11/24, 5:29:53 PM] Bruno Dumont: my way of love
[8/11/24, 5:30:00 PM] Bruno Dumont: I think I could kinda sort of it
[8/11/24, 5:30:13 PM] Bruno Dumont: but I cried a bit when he told me
[8/11/24, 5:30:21 PM] Bruno Dumont: cause I loved him
[8/11/24, 5:30:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: but I don't feel sad about it anymore
[8/11/24, 5:30:45 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn, I’m sorry
[8/11/24, 5:30:52 PM] Bruno Dumont: its fine
[8/11/24, 5:30:57 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I can relate
[8/11/24, 5:30:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: I learned from it
[8/11/24, 5:31:07 PM] Bruno Dumont: I feel like the way I treat my grandma changed
[8/11/24, 5:31:16 PM] Bruno Dumont: and other relationships
[8/11/24, 5:31:17 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Thats amazing
[8/11/24, 5:31:25 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't get sad for things like this
[8/11/24, 5:31:29 PM] Bruno Dumont: is just part of life
[8/11/24, 5:31:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: nothing will change if I dwell on it
[8/11/24, 5:33:10 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I wish I would remember to treat my grandpa better
[8/11/24, 5:33:16 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Or even my parents
[8/11/24, 5:33:35 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But I have so much less patience for them
[8/11/24, 5:33:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'll tell you one thing
[8/11/24, 5:33:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: that may sound strange
[8/11/24, 5:33:56 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It makes me sad that I would sometimes treat a stranger with more kindness than my family
[8/11/24, 5:33:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: but its how I feel
[8/11/24, 5:34:07 PM] Bruno Dumont: when they pass away
[8/11/24, 5:34:13 PM] Bruno Dumont: it doesn't really matter from them
[8/11/24, 5:34:21 PM] Bruno Dumont: it just matters for you
[8/11/24, 5:34:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: create the memories you want to have
[8/11/24, 5:34:39 PM] Bruno Dumont: because small problems just get washed away
[8/11/24, 5:34:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't regret much how my grandpa felt I just wished I could have experienced him more
[8/11/24, 5:35:03 PM] Bruno Dumont: but that's very peculiar about me
[8/11/24, 5:35:12 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I like that
[8/11/24, 5:35:13 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'm unable to be sad about things from the past in a strange way
[8/11/24, 5:35:22 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it’s a good thing
[8/11/24, 5:35:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: I do the same with my mom
[8/11/24, 5:35:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: I just hope I will never do this with you
[8/11/24, 5:35:39 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Too many people get dragged down by their past
[8/11/24, 5:36:01 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Me too bunbun, it would really make me sad if I treat you badly
[8/11/24, 5:36:14 PM] Bruno Dumont: we'll just hold each other accountable
[8/11/24, 5:36:20 PM] Bruno Dumont: I think the problem with parents
[8/11/24, 5:36:24 PM] Bruno Dumont: its the one sideness
[8/11/24, 5:36:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't have this problem with my dad
[8/11/24, 5:36:43 PM] Bruno Dumont: because our relationship its not one sided anymore
[8/11/24, 5:36:58 PM] Bruno Dumont: but that's just my guess
[8/11/24, 5:38:36 PM] Bruno Dumont: in the end your parents know you are their kid
[8/11/24, 5:38:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: its fine
[8/11/24, 5:38:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: as long as you are happy
[8/11/24, 5:38:50 PM] Bruno Dumont: its all that matters
[8/11/24, 5:38:53 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: What do you mean it’s not one sided anymore?
[8/11/24, 5:39:16 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't feel like
[8/11/24, 5:39:23 PM] Bruno Dumont: we are in two different points
[8/11/24, 5:39:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: in a way
[8/11/24, 5:39:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: the conversations are held from a point where he treats me like an equal
[8/11/24, 5:39:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: its very subtle
[8/11/24, 5:40:14 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm
[8/11/24, 5:40:17 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I see
[8/11/24, 5:40:17 PM] Bruno Dumont: but he acts in a way where the responsabilities for our relationships are divided in half
[8/11/24, 5:40:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: but my mom acts in a different way
[8/11/24, 5:40:32 PM] Bruno Dumont: we have clearly distict roles
[8/11/24, 5:40:41 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I think I feel that way with my mom
[8/11/24, 5:40:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: and I feel like she puts in my the weight of fitting into that role
[8/11/24, 5:41:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: with little to no effort from her part in updating this
[8/11/24, 5:41:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: she still expects me to behave like a little child in a way
[8/11/24, 5:41:47 PM] Bruno Dumont: instead of embracing a position of more like a friendship
[8/11/24, 5:41:51 PM] Bruno Dumont: where both work on it

[8/12/24, 10:01:24 AM] Bruno Dumont: to be honest with you it would have been an instant no if it was like ur Portuguese class 5 units
[8/12/24, 10:01:29 AM] Bruno Dumont: I can't fit that into my schedule
[8/12/24, 10:01:45 AM] Bruno Dumont: but I was indeed searching for a chill 1 to 2 unit class

CHINLANG 6 - 2 units
CS 111 - 5 units
PSYCH 1 - 5 units
MUSIC 12 - 1 unit
MATH 120 - 5 units
[8/12/24, 10:35:52 AM] Bruno Dumont: I plan on something on those lines
[8/12/24, 10:35:58 AM] Bruno Dumont: probably droping the math
[8/12/24, 10:36:01 AM] Bruno Dumont: or psych
[8/12/24, 10:59:53 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: The cs classes sound so cool
[8/12/24, 11:01:09 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: The math is also cool, but I would suggest taking the psych class for some variety in your day
[8/12/24, 11:01:28 AM] Bruno Dumont: it's kinda lame
[8/12/24, 11:01:32 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I gotta start thinking bout my classes as well

[8/12/24, 11:39:25 AM] Bruno Dumont: I'm liking my job
[8/12/24, 11:39:29 AM] Bruno Dumont: now I have an actual task
[8/12/24, 11:39:34 AM] Bruno Dumont: but I'm so dumb
[8/12/24, 11:39:39 AM] Bruno Dumont: my code takes a few minutes to run
[8/12/24, 11:39:42 AM] Bruno Dumont: like 20
[8/12/24, 11:39:47 AM] Bruno Dumont: and uses 1 giga of memory

[8/12/24, 3:41:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: Do you think it would be socially acceptable for a man to say their type is asians?
[8/12/24, 3:42:12 PM] Bruno Dumont: Cause I don’t think it’s socially acceptable to say your type is white you would prob come out as racist
[8/12/24, 4:23:47 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I think it’s not inherently racist to have a racial preference. It’s only bad if the preference is based on stereotypes (I think you can think of some), thinking a race is better than other, or anything that doesn’t recognize that there’s much more to a person than their race ‎<This message was edited>
[8/12/24, 4:25:02 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I have thought about this question a lot
[8/12/24, 4:26:10 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Because you know I find curly hair very attractive. That is borderline a racial preference because it’s not an Asian or Black feature (usually). Am I racist for liking it then? I don’t think so ‎<This message was edited>
[8/12/24, 4:27:18 PM] Bruno Dumont: Lol
[8/12/24, 4:27:19 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: What do you think?
[8/12/24, 4:27:26 PM] Bruno Dumont: It’s funny how you like curly hair
[8/12/24, 4:27:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: It seems so inconsequential to me
[8/12/24, 4:27:40 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yes It’s a little strange
[8/12/24, 4:27:51 PM] Bruno Dumont: You would have missed out on me if it wasn’t for my curls
[8/12/24, 4:27:53 PM] Bruno Dumont: Thank god
[8/12/24, 4:27:55 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Lolll
[8/12/24, 4:28:01 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s scary to think about
[8/12/24, 4:28:06 PM] Bruno Dumont: Like my hair preferences
[8/12/24, 4:28:18 PM] Bruno Dumont: Is cause I think shorter hair gives a more manly vibe
[8/12/24, 4:28:18 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: If you had cut your hair really short before ISO
[8/12/24, 4:28:28 PM] Bruno Dumont: And for me longer hair gives a more feminine vibe
[8/12/24, 4:28:30 PM] Bruno Dumont: And I like it
[8/12/24, 4:28:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: But it’s not that important to me
[8/12/24, 4:28:48 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: me too honestly. But it’s more inconvenient
[8/12/24, 4:29:25 PM] Bruno Dumont: I like more feminine figures

[8/12/24, 4:30:15 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Speaking of this, do you wanna see my swim suit?
[8/12/24, 4:30:20 PM] Bruno Dumont: I dislike gender rated behaviours
[8/12/24, 4:30:26 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: What does this mean
[8/12/24, 4:30:28 PM] Bruno Dumont: Like acting too girly or even too manly
[8/12/24, 4:30:48 PM] Bruno Dumont: When most of your personality its just the steriotipical gender
[8/12/24, 4:30:56 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Hmm

[8/12/24, 4:52:47 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Think I’ll rather have 1-2 comfortable trips than 4-5 budget trips

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-zMfuFR70I/?igsh=dGg3YWVhcnY1MnIw
[8/20/24, 4:34:06 AM] Bruno Dumont: Well…
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-3XSZqvCpL/?igsh=MW9xOTRrNzJuaW9xag==
[8/20/24, 4:58:45 AM] Bruno Dumont: We can give it another try
[8/20/24, 5:01:17 AM] Bruno Dumont: Fun fact: the rotation of the moon around the earth and the rotation of the moon around itself are synchronized and this is of course no coincidence. This happens because of the tides. The same process that causes tides cause this and the process is the difference in gravitational force the two ends of the earth and moon feel (since one end if further apart) this makes the rotation around itself of both to slow down till its synchronized but since the earth is so much bigger this process is much slower on earth hence why we are not synchronized but the moon is
[8/20/24, 5:02:24 AM] Bruno Dumont: Fun fact 2: the moon was created when a planet with half size of the earth called thea (might have some misspelling errors here) collided with the earth got destroyed and the debrees from the explosion orbited earth and got together to create the moon

[8/21/24, 5:25:02 PM] Bruno Dumont: Boa noite pessoal, queria pedir desculpas por hoje (para todos os envolvidos). Queria falar um pouquinho do pq eu sempre gero climão. Eu tenho um transtorno de personalidade grave, então meu humor muda bem rápido. Pessoas comuns tem uma coisa chamada "estabilidade de humor". Enquanto vocês riem, vocês riem. Meu humor já é diferente, mesmo que eu ria de algo, pode virar uma "chavinha" na minha cabeça e eu fico chateada ou com raiva de coisas que os outros acham bobagem, o limiar pra esses sentimentos ruins é bem menor. Eu faço tratamento já tem um tempo, 12 anos, e eu sei absolutamente tudo sobre o meu problema, mas eu percebi algo hoje: eu posso controlar vários aspectos sobre essa doença, mas não posso mudar o que me afeta ou não, vão sempre existir situações diferentes em que eu não vou estar preparada. E eu não acho, de forma alguma, que vocês tenham culpa disso, e nem mesmo devem mudar o jeito por minha causa, eu só sou alguém que "veio com um defeito" pra vida, e faz parte, ninguém tem culpa (exceto aqueles que causaram esse transtorno, durante minha criação). Então desculpa, odeio fazer pessoas lidarem comigo, é um saco ser um saco pros outros. E foi mal pelo textão também, fiquem bem ♥️

[8/24/24, 10:24:08 AM] Bruno Dumont: I just got really anxious
[8/24/24, 10:24:14 AM] Bruno Dumont: I'm shaking rn

[8/24/24, 10:25:47 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I planned to talk later, but if you feel like that will worsen your feeling of anxiety, we can try now
[8/24/24, 10:26:09 AM] Bruno Dumont: lemme tell you what I was thinking
[8/24/24, 10:28:19 AM] Bruno Dumont: I just think the things I did that annoyed you were things you gave me permition to do in a certain way. Like teasing you with things that are sexual or making a joke about the "silent treatment" and I stopped when you explicitly told me to do so when you said that you were serious about the photo or when you told me that really made you sad. I just thing that something happened with you and the arrays of things I can do you find funny and teasy got smaller but you just expect me to understand that without you telling me
[8/24/24, 10:29:05 AM] Bruno Dumont: but after I calmed down I understand that it is important for me to understand what makes you sad
[8/24/24, 10:29:16 AM] Bruno Dumont: I just wish you would tell me first and then get upset
[8/24/24, 10:29:26 AM] Bruno Dumont: but when you communicate with me its already too late

[8/24/24, 10:31:21 AM] Bruno Dumont: cause you told me you like when I joke about what makes you sad
[8/24/24, 10:31:25 AM] Bruno Dumont: and take it in a lighter way
[8/24/24, 10:31:35 AM] Bruno Dumont: expect when I cant and it makes it worse
[8/24/24, 10:31:49 AM] Bruno Dumont: and I can only know after you get upset
[8/24/24, 10:31:57 AM] Bruno Dumont: like when you texted me that you were getting annoyed

[8/24/24, 10:32:47 AM] Bruno Dumont: its because it happened every day this week
[8/24/24, 10:33:11 AM] Bruno Dumont: first it was the silent treatment
[8/24/24, 10:33:18 AM] Bruno Dumont: then it was something else I can't remember
[8/24/24, 10:33:27 AM] Bruno Dumont: then it was when I told you about your muscles
[8/24/24, 10:33:36 AM] Bruno Dumont: now it was this
[8/24/24, 10:33:48 AM] Bruno Dumont: it seems like every time I call you something I do upsets you
[8/24/24, 10:33:54 AM] Bruno Dumont: and it makes me feel like a terrible partner
[8/24/24, 10:34:10 AM] Bruno Dumont: cause I know you are sad
[8/24/24, 10:34:15 AM] Bruno Dumont: and I try to cheer you up
[8/24/24, 10:34:22 AM] Bruno Dumont: and everything I do just makes it worse
[8/24/24, 10:34:34 AM] Bruno Dumont: like when I was playing league you told me you were feeling lonely
[8/24/24, 10:34:50 AM] Bruno Dumont: and I though I could just call you and we could do our stuff while keeping each other company
[8/24/24, 10:34:54 AM] Bruno Dumont: and you just seemed more annoyed at me

[8/24/24, 10:38:35 AM] Bruno Dumont: like I was mistreating you
[8/24/24, 10:38:48 AM] Bruno Dumont: but I felt a little blindsighted in some way
[8/24/24, 10:38:59 AM] Bruno Dumont: cause I always try very hard to understand the boundaries with you
[8/24/24, 10:39:07 AM] Bruno Dumont: and they seem to suddently change
[8/24/24, 10:39:10 AM] Bruno Dumont: and its now all my fault
[8/24/24, 10:39:33 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But that’s not what I was trying to do when explaining why i was upset

[8/30/24, 11:54:51 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha
[8/30/24, 11:54:57 AM] Bruno Dumont: in physics you can only say something for certain when the experiments are made
[8/30/24, 11:55:07 AM] Bruno Dumont: but what exists is the theorical model
[8/30/24, 11:55:26 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I’m kinda confused by the 2d cone diagram they had tho
[8/30/24, 11:55:43 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: To explain the space we could ever interact with?
[8/30/24, 11:56:36 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Fucking hell its so cool
‎[8/30/24, 11:58:21 AM] Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted
[8/30/24, 11:58:38 AM] Pretty Girl 🐦: It’s so cool because I’m seeing things I learned in math 21 being applied to the explaination of how black holes exist
‎[8/30/24, 11:59:18 AM] Bruno Dumont: ‎audio omitted
[8/30/24, 11:59:38 AM] Bruno Dumont: lol so glad you liked it what math 21 thing did you see on the video?
[8/30/24, 11:59:45 AM] Bruno Dumont: I didn't remember any calculus on it
[8/30/24, 12:00:52 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha just small things, like coordinate substituition (we used for vectors) and the idea of limit going to inifinity applied to time
[8/30/24, 12:01:11 PM] Bruno Dumont: make sense
[8/30/24, 12:01:25 PM] Bruno Dumont: its cause I've first seen those ideas outside of calculus
[8/30/24, 12:01:32 PM] Bruno Dumont: so I didn't even thought about this
[8/30/24, 12:01:36 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Yeah,
[8/30/24, 12:01:48 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: That’s why it prob seems elementary to you
[8/30/24, 12:01:59 PM] Bruno Dumont: it doesn't sound elementary
[8/30/24, 12:02:01 PM] Bruno Dumont: but natural
[8/30/24, 12:02:09 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But to me, math 21 was my first math course where I got some understanding of math beyond algebra ‎<This message was edited>
[8/30/24, 12:02:12 PM] Bruno Dumont: if that makes sense
[8/30/24, 12:02:21 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I didn’t understand shit in ap calc
[8/30/24, 12:02:41 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't think like oh this is this technique that I learned in X place I just think like yeah that seems like the correct approach
[8/30/24, 12:03:03 PM] Bruno Dumont: understandable
[8/30/24, 12:03:13 PM] Bruno Dumont: I still think its crazy people learning calc in hs
[8/30/24, 12:03:27 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: You think it should be earlier?
[8/30/24, 12:03:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: no lol
[8/30/24, 12:03:39 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh
[8/30/24, 12:03:41 PM] Bruno Dumont: in Brasil you only learn it in college
[8/30/24, 12:03:56 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Haha I though you mean we should introduce such concepts earlier or something
[8/30/24, 12:04:08 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Which I think would be interesting to try
[8/30/24, 12:04:20 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't think calculus is the problem
[8/30/24, 12:04:27 PM] Bruno Dumont: if you learn math well enough
[8/30/24, 12:04:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: if you have a good enough base
[8/30/24, 12:04:53 PM] Bruno Dumont: you are fine learning calculus when you need to use it
[8/30/24, 12:05:07 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: What is a good “base”
[8/30/24, 12:05:12 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: That sounds very abstract
[8/30/24, 12:05:20 PM] Bruno Dumont: well
[8/30/24, 12:05:29 PM] Bruno Dumont: being confutable manipulating algebraic expressions
[8/30/24, 12:05:38 PM] Bruno Dumont: being good at math in general
[8/30/24, 12:05:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: like the problem solving approach of math
[8/30/24, 12:05:55 PM] Bruno Dumont: understanding very well all of the pre-calc
[8/30/24, 12:05:55 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I see

[8/30/24, 12:06:12 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I remember learning about functions
[8/30/24, 12:06:31 PM] Bruno Dumont: but I'm not the right person to ask this
[8/30/24, 12:06:37 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: And all I understood was, oh you just draw a line on a chart
[8/30/24, 12:06:43 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't know how normal people learn math
[8/30/24, 12:07:04 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Education is definitely a complicated topic
[8/30/24, 12:07:14 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: lol bunbun too smart

[8/30/24, 12:07:31 PM] Bruno Dumont: I don't remember when I learned about functions
[8/30/24, 12:07:37 PM] Bruno Dumont: it just seems so intuitive to me
[8/30/24, 12:07:45 PM] Bruno Dumont: you put something in something comes out chill
[8/30/24, 12:07:54 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Damn, I’m envious
[8/30/24, 12:08:01 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Oh well

[8/30/24, 12:08:25 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: I don’t think my sister inherited rhe intuition from my mom either so
[8/30/24, 12:08:31 PM] Bruno Dumont: I'll scout the internet for more interesting math/science videos
[8/30/24, 12:08:43 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Ok! Thanks bunbun

[8/30/24, 12:09:35 PM] Bruno Dumont: are not as dumb as their parents
[8/30/24, 12:09:42 PM] Bruno Dumont: it is statistically accurate
[8/30/24, 12:09:46 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: Well, this makes sense
[8/30/24, 12:09:57 PM] Bruno Dumont: that's in everything
[8/30/24, 12:10:03 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: But, statistics can be manipulated
[8/30/24, 12:10:10 PM] Pretty Girl 🐦: If we play our cards right

[10/8/24, 5:25:05 PM] Bruno Dumont: Second-year Symbolic Systems student at Stanford University with a concentration in Natural Language, with a strong foundation in critical thinking, cultural analysis, and programming. My passion for language and human-computer interaction led me to pursue this interdisciplinary degree, where I explore the intersection of technology, communication, and society.

My Highlights: • Interned at the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute, where I identified critical knowledge gaps in the unpublished research on Dr. King and collaborated on digitizing physical volumes to enhance accessibility. • Designed a Post-AP Latin curriculum at Blair Academy, titled "Roman Perceptions of the Self and the Other," to address student dissatisfaction and foster critical thinking and empathy for diverse narratives. • Founded Latin in China (LIC), an online platform connecting Chinese students with educators in classical studies, offering educational resources, Latin courses, and symposiums to ~40 active students and 4 teachers.

I'm a passionate learner with a drive to bridge gaps in education and access to knowledge. My work spans language, culture, and technology, and I thrive in projects that require collaboration and a blend of historical and technical expertise.

My Interests: 📚 Deeply interested in equity, belonging, and global education, having founded a platform to connect Chinese students with classical studies resources and contributed to cultural equity initiatives. 🧘‍♀️ Enthusiastic about classical philosophy, particularly Stoicism, and regularly host discussions on its relevance to modern life. 🃏 Passionate about board and card games for their social interaction and strategic elements, appreciating the blend of probability and decision-making.
