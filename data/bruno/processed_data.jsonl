{"input": "I think you two would find value in each other", "output": "but didn't got the chance to experience it"}
{"input": "Ahh", "output": "Maybe it's like math I could like more If I see something good but humanities at my school was just so fucking boring memorizing historical facts or in linguistics having to know 47 different rules to write and accent in portuguese"}
{"input": "Yeah that doesn\u2019t capture the essence and goal of the humanities", "output": "neither does math at school covers the essence of math"}
{"input": "Yep", "output": "that's why highschool sucks"}
{"input": "That\u2019s why I\u2019m so interested in education", "output": "specially at Brazil"}
{"input": "It\u2019s so important, yet no one in power cares Because they use it as a tool to do crowd control", "output": "How would you introduce me to the real point of humanities?"}

{"input": "And have you discuss the short excerpts with a good group of studnegsv It\u2019s not a full on book. It\u2019s short excerpts from Greek philosopher", "output": "discussing seems cool"}
{"input": "Very short paragraphs, easy to read", "output": "Answering your question To introduce you to the real point of math For me math is about patterns recognitions and not about perfoming calculation There's a saying I like that says math is everything else you can't do with a calculator I think someone can only enjoy math when they see clever and creative solutions to problems"}
{"input": "Hmmmm just like how history is not about memorizing historical facts But they are important to know I can see your point", "output": "I think to see why I like math I would introduce to game theory maybe not exactly game theory but math games in general"}
{"input": "\u200eimage omitted I saw these the last time I went to the book store", "output": "I used a poor choice of words"}
{"input": "No idea what game theory is tho", "output": "game theory is different from what I wanted to say there are some questions about math games and winning strategies for exemple There are 2 piles of rocks both with 20 rocks. 2 players are competing and their goal is to take the last rock of the piles but on every turn you can take how many rocks you want but only from one pile. Which player has a strategie that can guarantee he will win 100% of the time?"}
{"input": "Making the other person take a factor of 20 Oh wait we want the last", "output": "Let's play the game do you want to be the first or second to play?"}
{"input": "Lemme shower first yeah?", "output": "Really already showering?"}
{"input": "I\u2019ve been standing in a towel for like 30 mins hahaha", "output": "It's not been a month yet \ud83d\udc40"}
{"input": "Let\u2019s do the game But why are there two piles", "output": "that's now humanities you don't as why"}
{"input": "Haha", "output": "that's not humanities you don't ask why fuck I don't know how to type 20, 20 do you wanna go first or second?"}
{"input": "I\u2019ll go first 2 from p1", "output": "18, 20 my move 18, 18"}
{"input": "Wait there\u2019s no limit to how many rocks you can take?", "output": "yeah but only from 1 pile"}
{"input": "\u8279 Umm lemme think Whatever, 1 from p2", "output": "17, 18 17, 17"}
{"input": "Stop copying me Wtf why are there two pilesb", "output": "I don't get the question"}
{"input": "Why make this question have two piles It\u2019s so much easier with 1", "output": "yeah you just take all of them out and win that's the trivial case now we're playing the easy case that is 2 piles and then you work out the general case with N piles"}
{"input": "Does it matter who goes first", "output": "yeah one of the 2 players can guarantee his victory with one strategy"}
{"input": "Did I fuck up", "output": "your job is to find who that player is"}
{"input": "Hmm give me some time on this Or a hint", "output": "you don't have to this if you dont want the hint I would say is try playing games and recognizing a pattern play with only 5 rocks on each pile"}
{"input": "Nah, I\u2019m gonna give it a try. Ok", "output": "you can play with me I can beat you 100% of the time as long as you don't know the strategy"}
{"input": "And you have to get the last rock form both piles? How is that physically possible", "output": "exemple of a game 5, 5"}
{"input": "Ohhh I get it more now So it\u2019s the last last stone", "output": "we can do it later"}
{"input": "Not the last stone from each pile", "output": "if you want in person"}
{"input": "Ok", "output": "But I don't know if you'll enjoy"}
{"input": "Then my strategy might work Prepare to lose", "output": "ok then want to be 1 or 2 player?"}
{"input": "Haha I\u2019m just joking, my strategy is only half formed Is it not always 2 players?", "output": "player 1 or player 2 first or second"}
{"input": "Ohh, I\u2019m not ready yet, I still have to test it I gotta do my Ling quiz first Man this game is hurting my brain", "output": "Don't do it then I just showed you this because math games are fun and interactive ways of solving hard math problems"}
{"input": "Lol I think I\u2019ll stick to liking math in a humanities way", "output": "maybe"}
{"input": "Brunch soon?", "output": "Ok Hey where are you going for brunch?"}
{"input": "Do you have a bandaid", "output": "I can look for one Hey Im here"}

Im not sure how to explain it", "output": "the lagrange multiplier is like a detector of all critical points of a function subjected to a manifold (a manifold is just a name given to a part of space like this hyperparabola) you used the lagrange multipler and found those two critical points since the maximum is always a critical point the maximum if exists must be one of the two but look there is a point bigger than both so no way a maximum could exist"}

{"input": "Oh nice! What did you come up with", "output": "In one point of her essay she comments on negative bias that the human brain pays more attention to negative experiences than positive and I told her I would argue as follows The human brain is wired to pay attention to novel experiences. If something happens a lot your brain gets use to it and it is not seen as something worth remembering. That means that pretty persons don't pay attention to good experiences related to their beauty such as compliments. However, bad experiences hit much harder cause they are not used to it This explains why if you compliment a pretty girl that is insecure she won't mind much but if someone says something bad that might be very harmful is one of the argument that makes more sense with the previous one but I though it was cool I can send u her entire essay if you want to read it lol"}

{"input": "What do you mean it\u2019s not one sided anymore?", "output": "I don't feel like we are in two different points in a way the conversations are held from a point where he treats me like an equal its very subtle"}

{"input": "I think I feel that way with my mom", "output": "and I feel like she puts in my the weight of fitting into that role with little to no effort from her part in updating this she still expects me to behave like a little child in a way instead of embracing a position of more like a friendship where both work on it I don't know if it makes sense I'm kinda realizing this now"}
{"input": "It does", "output": "I never though about this before its sad that I can't bring this up to her she wouldn't understand and would get upset"}
{"input": "We are moving into an adult role and it\u2019s a interesting shift and it\u2019s our parents\u2019 first time of being parents as well", "output": "if we have a kid I won't allow them to be adults I'll trap them as kids forever my babies"}
