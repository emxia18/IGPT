A person spends an average of 1/3 of their life sleeping, but despite this, not everyone pays due attention to sleep. According to a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention one-third of American adults are sleep-deprived. The situation is even worse between college students, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 91% of all teens fail to get that amount of sleep on a consistent basis.In the midst of this silent sleep deprivation epidemic the UC Berkeley professor of neuroscience and sleep researcher Matt Walker gives a talk about the importance of sleep and health problems associated with sleep deprivation. In \u201cSleep Is Your Superpower\u201d Matt uses analogies, emotional diction and statistics from a number of different researches to effectively convince the audience that sleep is extremely important for all aspects of wellness."}

That means that pretty persons don't pay attention to good experiences related to their beauty such as compliments. However, bad experiences hit much harder cause they are not used to it This explains why if you compliment a pretty girl that is insecure she won't mind much but if someone says something bad that might be very harmful is one of the argument that makes more sense with the previous one but I though it was cool I can send u her entire essay if you want to read it lol"}
